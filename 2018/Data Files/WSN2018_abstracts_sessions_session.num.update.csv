"Wood, Chelsea",chelwood@uw.edu,2018-09-02 11:55,EVIDENCE FROM MUSEUM SPECIMENS CONFIRMS HISTORICAL DATA: 86 YEARS OF INCREASING PARASITISM FOR PUGET SOUND ENGLISH SOLE,"Does disturbance increase or decrease parasite transmission among wildlife hosts? Ecologists cannot answer this controversial question, in part because few historical datasets rigorously document parasite abundance. Without such a baseline, it is difficult to determine whether contemporary ecosystems are experiencing elevated parasite burdens. Here, we investigate change over time in the abundance of a parasite that affects the economic value of a fish species. *Clavinema mariae* is a nematode parasite of benthic fishes that is common in English sole (*Parophrys vetulus*) of Puget Sound, WA. We obtained historical records of its abundance from the literature and from unpublished government agency data, and resampled the same locations using the same methods in 2017. We also used a new approach by estimating the *C. mariae* burden for museum specimens of English sole collected between 1930 and 2016. Both the historical data and museum specimen data suggested increases over time in *C. mariae* abundance, with robust agreement between the two approaches. In addition to documenting a previously unrecognized ~eightfold increase in the burden of an economically important parasite, our work demonstrates – for the first time – that parasitological examination of liquid-preserved museum specimens can produce reliable data on long-term trends in parasite abundance, at a much greater temporal resolution than is possible to obtain from historical records.",UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"HOWARD, I",,,,,NA,NA,"DAVIS, E","LIPPERT, G","QUINN, TP","WOOD, CL",,,,,5,No,Applied Ecology,Community Ecology,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",5,1,,Applied Ecology,

Crustose coralline algae (CCA), such as Porolithon onkodes, are important structural calcifying components on coral reefs and they grow across a range of depths. This study investigated the interactive effects of light quantity and quality and pCO2 on P. onkodes to determine if CCA are impacted differentially by OA at depth. Light regimes that occur at shallow and deep reefs were simulated in mesocosms in Moorea, French Polynesia at both ambient and high pCO2 treatments.

The sea otter population has increased exponentially in Southeast Alaska since reintroduction of approximately 400 animals in the late 1960’s to 25,000 animals in 2011. Shellfish play a significant role in Alaska Native culture and well being, as these harvests maintain customs and traditions, supplement local economies, and provide healthy traditional foods. We conducted 48 interviews with tribal members in four Southeast Alaskan communities to document how the expanding sea otter population is affecting food security in the region. Additionally, we conducted intertidal surveys of butter clam (Saxidomus gigantea) abundance and size at sites that varied in both sea otter predation and human harvest to document how these two predators influence clam communities. Interviews and intertidal surveys revealed decreases in shellfish availability, size, and number of harvest locations where sea otters are present. Interview respondents suggested the following community management strategies in response to increasing competition with sea otters: 1) coordinated sea otter hunting near villages to keep sea otter populations at low levels and 2) relocating to new shellfish harvest locations away from sea otters. Understanding the complex social and ecological dimensions that define this human-sea otter conflict may help provide information that can be used to make sustainable and ecosystem-based management decisions.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,University of Alaska Fairbanks,University of Alaska Anchorage,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Ibarra, S.N.",,,,,NA,NA,"Eckert, G.L.","Langdon, S.J.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Applied Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,1,,Applied Ecology,

Adult green crab catches can fluctuate from only a handful of crabs to several thousand between sites less than five kilometers apart. Because the impacts of invasive species are often tightly linked to density, managers need to know not just where an invasive species such as green crab will occur, but how abundant they will be in order to effectively mitigate potential impacts. We used eight years of trapping data and gradient boosted regression trees to build a series of models predicting green crab occupancy, catch, and growth rates across 72 sites, which varied over a range of physical and biological attributes. From these models we were able to identify the site-level attributes that lead to superdense populations of European green crab. Physical characteristics, such as inlet length and freshwater outflow volume, significantly affected green crab abundance. Additionally, there were strong relationships, both negative and positive, between green crab and native crab abundances at the site-level. By using attributes readily available through spatial data sources this predictive tool can be quickly utilized by managers making decisions about where to apply early detection and eradication efforts for this species.",Simon Fraser University,Simon Fraser University,Department of Fisheries and Oceans,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Howard, B.R.",,,,,NA,NA,"Côté, I.M.","Therriault, T.W.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Applied Ecology,Population Biology and Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,1,,Applied Ecology,

Yet climate change is expected to significantly alter larval connectivity of many marine species, raising the question of whether marine reserves designed today will still be effective into the future. Here we predict how alternative marine reserve designs will affect fishery yields under likely scenarios for future larval dispersal, using empirically-grounded models that incorporate dispersal estimates from Regional Ocean Modeling Systems. We use the models to predict the outcome of marine reserve design, both under current conditions and under plausible scenarios for future larval dispersal patterns. We show that networks of reserves optimized for future climate conditions differ substantially from networks designed for today’s conditions. However, the benefits of redesign are modest: a well-designed set of reserves focused only on current conditions commonly produces outcomes within 10 percent of the best redesigned network, and far outperforms haphazardly designed networks. Thus, well-designed marine reserves are likely to pay dividends even if the networks are not modified to keep up with environmental change.",Florida State University,University of Vigo,University of California Santa Barbara,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Rassweiler, A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Ojea, E.","Costello, C.",,,,,,,3,Yes,Applied Ecology,Fisheries Ecology,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,1,,Applied Ecology,

Estuaries are particularly vulnerable to disturbances due to resource use and other human activities. Anthropogenic disturbances can alter the physical environment and disrupt ecosystem function, leading to both direct and indirect population impacts. While the effects of disturbance frequency and magnitude on species diversity and competitive interactions have been studied, their effects on predator-prey interactions have not been investigated. To address this, we developed simple dynamic models to examine the effects of varying disturbance frequency and magnitude on prey population persistence in predator-prey systems. We then extended this analysis to a more realistic model of eastern oysters (*Crassostrea virginica*) and their predator, the southern oyster drill (*Stramonita haemastoma*), to assess how disturbances, characterized by changes in estuarine salinity, affect the predator-prey interaction. Our results reveal that increasing the magnitude of disturbance increases the probability of prey population extinction more than increasing frequency. Additionally, effects differ depending on predator-prey dynamics and whether the disturbance affects population abundance or demographic rates. Oysters provide habitat to valuable commercial fishes and invaluable ecosystem services, so examining how varying disturbances impact both short-term and long-term population outcomes is critical to management efforts.","University of North Carolina, Wilmington",Oregon State University,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Commander, C.J.C.",,,,,NA,NA,"White, J.W.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Applied Ecology,Population Biology and Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,1,,Applied Ecology,

Here, we examine prey selection and behavior in *Cancer productus* (the red rock crab) when presented with three closely related species of gastropod prey from the northeastern Pacific: *Nucella ostrina* (the striped dogwhelk), *N. canaliculata* (the channeled dogwhelk), and *N. lamellosa* (the frilled dogwhelk). In each trial, individual adult crabs were presented with nine gastropods (3 of each species) distributed evenly in a 3 x 3 grid. Gastropods were ranked in the order in which they were consumed. Each crab participated in two feeding trials (14 crabs, 28 trials). *C. productus* has a “preference” for *N. lamellosa* (p = 0.009), despite increased grappling, handling, and consumption times (p < 0.001, each). However, crabs were also most likely to attack the first gastropod they detected as they worked through the grid (p < 0.001). Furthermore, crabs appeared to have difficulty detecting the last two gastropods in each trial, which always included at least one of *N. ostrina* and/or *N. canaliculata*. As *N. lamellosa* is naturally the largest of the three species, and crabs often encountered either *N. ostrina* or *N. canaliculata* without recognizing them as prey, we suggest that “preference” for *N. lamellosa* is a result of crabs being more likely to detect and attack the larger species of *Nucella*. Detection is therefore an important variable influencing prey selection in crabs.",University of Alberta,University of Alberta,University of Alberta,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Barclay, K.

MPAs typically have higher biomass of harvested species within them than is found outside of them, which may result in resource limitation and intraspecific competition for resources among them. I evaluated whether a species known to have higher biomass in MPAs, California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher), is prey limited within them. I (1) conducted foraging observations, to test whether foraging behavior of sheephead differed inside versus outside of MPAs; (2) verified that biomass of sheephead was higher in the MPAs studied than in nearby areas open to fishing; and (3) tested the prediction that prey density would be lower in MPAs than outside them. I studied six MPAs in southern California. Underwater visual transects by scuba divers provided data on fish biomass and prey density. Foraging observations by divers quantified fish foraging behavior (foraging rate and time spent searching). Biomass of California sheephead was higher within MPAs than outside and biomass was higher in older MPAs than younger ones. Prey densities differed inside vs. outside MPAs and seemed correlate with sheephead biomass. Sheephead exhibited different foraging behavior inside versus outside MPAs, with longer searching periods for food and a higher foraging rate within MPAs.

"Sadowski, Jason",jsadowski@ucdavis.edu,2018-10-04 19:59,THE CASCADING EFFECT OF TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN RISK,"Predators are known to have strong effects on their prey through both direct consumption of prey and through non-consumptive processes. When exposed to risk, prey often reduce their foraging rates. However, predators are often mobile and create periods of relative safety and risk. When risky periods are long, they may be more impactful than multiple short periods of risk even if the total amount of time is equivalent. We developed a model of prey decision-making under temporal variability and tested the model using a tritrophic system. We measured how the foraging rate of *Nucella ostrina* on barnacles (*Balanus glandula*/*Cthamalus dalli*) changes in response to crab predators (*Cancer productus*). Over 8 weeks, snails were exposed to crabs for 100% of the time, 50% of the time or 0% of the time. We used two 50% treatments and exposed snails to crabs either every other week, or for 4 weeks in a row. We also measured how snail tissue mass and shell mass changed.

Our model indicated that snails would reduce growth and foraging rates during longer periods of risk relative to shorter periods of risk. We found some differences between the model and our experimental results. All crab treatments suppressed snail growth and barnacle consumption. We found that shorter periods of risk had a smaller effect than longer periods of risk. Therefore, the distribution of predation risk through time has a greater impact on prey foraging than we would expect. Our evidence indicates that invertebrate prey can use their physiological state to determine when to flee from predation risk.","University of California, Davis

"Ng, Gabriel",gng@ucdavis.edu,2018-10-05 17:03,HOW MIGHT FEAR INFLUENCE THE STRENGTH OF TROPHIC CASCADES?,"Trophic cascades and the indirect effects that underlie them play a large part in structuring communities. Though removal of prey by predators is a large component of trophic cascades, studies also demonstrate that fear-induced behaviors in prey can benefit a basal resource as much as predation by a top consumer. Such benefits of fear arise from reductions in foraging by prey as they flee or hide from predators. At the same time, while fear clearly contributes to how trophic cascades operate, the net effect of fear remains unknown. The ambiguity arises because fear can have dual effects. First, fear can strengthen a trophic cascade by reducing prey foraging and thus rates of consumption of a basal resource, as noted above. Second, fear can encourage anti-predatory responses that increase the survival of prey, elevating their aggregate ability to deplete the basal resource. Here, we measured the net effect of fear within a tri-trophic food chain with *Tegula funebralis*, the black turban snail, as the prey species and the green alga, *Ulva* sp., as the basal resource. Our predators consisted of either the ochre seastar, *Pisaster ochraceus*, or the red rock crab, *Cancer productus*. Since these two predators have different handling times when consuming *T. funebralis*, we hypothesized that predator identity would influence how the loss of fear might affect the resultant trophic cascade. We discuss the role of fear in indirect effects and highlight how fear behavior may be lost in a changing environment.","Bodega Marine Laboratory

Nesting seabirds have been found to provide important nutrient subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems, as they tend to form large dense aggregations and deposit large amounts of fecal biomass. Changes in these seabird densities have been found to cause significant shifts to vegetation communities. In California, two of the Channel Islands support large nesting colonies of Western Gulls (*Larus occidentalis*), a generalist carnivore known to forage on human refuse. However, the extent of nutrient deposition by Western Gulls on these islands ecosystems, and how foraging on human refuse may change these deposition patters, remains unclear. We studied the behavior of Western gulls on Santa Barbara and Anacapa Islands to assess propensity to forage as human commensals and estimate wild and human refuse-derived deposition on the islands. Extrapolating to the entirety of the nesting colonies, we provide a first glance into the importance these large seabird aggregations may have to the California Channel Islands and the role urban foraging may have in shaping nutrient provisioning.","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, UC Santa Barbara","Biological Sciences, San Jose State University","Environmental Science, Policy & Management, UC Berkeley","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, UC Santa Barbara","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, UC Santa Barbara",,,,,NA,NA,"Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, UC Santa Barbara",,,,"Guerra, A.S.",,,,,NA,NA,"Shaffer, S.A.","Nuñez, T.A.","Klope, M","Bui, A","Young, H.S.",,,,6,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Behavioral Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,2,,Behavioral Ecology,

In forested patches, sea urchins are well fed and contain high energy content through gonad production, while those in barrens patches are starved and lack fully developed gonads. We examined how this variation in prey condition influences patch selection by a major urchin predator, the Southern sea otter *Enhydra lutris*. Specifically, the condition (i.e., gonad index) of purple sea urchins *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus* was examined to determine how prey quality influences the foraging behavior of sea otters. We conducted extensive shore observations of otter foraging behavior, combined with subtidal surveys at focal urchin patches that were paired with laboratory evaluations of urchin gonad condition. Additional subtidal surveys were conducted throughout the region to track changing urchin demographics (e.g., density, size structure, gonad index) and the extent of barren-forest patches across the study area. Results from our two-year study indicate that sea otters preferentially target gravid urchins inside of forested patches and mostly ignore those in urchin barrens. We demonstrate a logistic relationship between otter patch selection and gonad index. Our findings suggest that prey quality is an important consideration for evaluating the potential strength of trophic cascades and the ability of predators to control herbivore populations.","University of California, Santa Cruz, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology","University of California, Santa Cruz, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology","University of California, Santa Cruz, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology","U.

On coral reefs, their impacts have been described in detail for decades, leading to the expectation that future storms should have similar effects. This expectation relies on the assumption that storm intensities will remain unchanged, and the impacted coral reef communities are similar to those of the recent past; neither assumption is correct. This study quantified the effects of two category five hurricanes on the shallow reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands, where 31 y of monitoring reveal chronic coral mortality, increasing macroalgal abundance, and three other major hurricanes that caused acute coral mortality. Contextualized by these trends, the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria (September 2017) on coral cover statistically were not discernable, and were absolutely small but relatively large. Mean absolute cover declined only 1-4%, and relatively by 12–21%. Primed by decadal increases in abundance, macroalgae responded to the hurricanes with large absolute and relative increases in abundance.

In marine systems, organisms supply limiting nutrients to the ecosystem via excretion of metabolic waste products. Surprisingly, relatively little is known about the magnitude and variability of this recycling regime at the species- or community-level, especially in temperate kelp forests. To address these questions, we investigated the supply of nutrients excreted by the dominant members of the fish community in California. Rapid field incubations were conducted to measure the amount of dissolved ammonium (NH~4~^+^) released per individual (n=550) as a function of fish size across 40 common species that cumulatively represent 90% of the fish biomass. Ammonium excretion rates were combined with fish density and size structure from visual SCUBA
surveys to calculate the total nutrients supplied by fishes at the population and community levels. Our preliminary results indicate that fishes contribute a substantial amount of nitrogen to the ecosystem (5- 10 mmol NH~4~^+^ m^-2^ day^-1^), potentially surpassing the flux of nitrate delivered by upwelling and other oceanographic processes. These rates are consistent with those reported for tropical reefs but are among the first in temperate systems, indicating that fish-derived nutrients may be an underappreciated process that influences kelp forest productivity, especially during low nutrient conditions (i.e. El Niño).

OA effects on organisms may be amplified or reduced by species interactions as they propagate to population levels, altering impacts predicted by studies of individual responses in isolation. The calcifying bryozoan, *Membranipora membranacea*, and the predatory nudibranch, *Corambe steinbergae*, a predator-prey system regulated by predator-induced defenses and space limitation, present a unique system to investigate OA effects at multiple levels. We experimentally quantified OA effects across a pH range from 7.0 to 7.9 on bryozoan growth and predator-induced spine formation, with or without waterborne predator cue. Bryozoans exhibited maximum growth at moderately low pH (7.6), and continued spine formation across the pH range tested. Using a spatially-explicit model of colony growth, where area is a proxy for colony fitness, we assessed the population-level impacts of these experimentally-determined individual-level effects in the context of space limitation. The area-based fitness costs associated with defense measured at the individual level led to amplified effects predicted for the population level due to competition. Additional population-level parameters such as population density and settlement time also altered the cost of defense predicted by individual-level responses. Our coupled experimental and modeling results emphasize the need to consider population-level processes when assessing ecological responses to environmental stresses.","University of Washington, School of Oceanography","University of Washington, School of Oceanography",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Seroy, S.K.",,,,,NA,NA,"Grünbaum, D",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,Population Biology and Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,3,,Community Ecology,

To date, research on SSWD community-level impacts has focused on consumptive effects (CEs). However, *Pisaster* also have non-consumptive effects (NCEs) by modifying prey behavior, which can have cascading effects on other community members. Here, we combined laboratory and field experiments to examine *Pisaster* NCEs on *Tegula funebralis* grazing, and cascading effects on macroalgae. Cage-exclusion experiments across the *Pisaster* abundance gradient indicated that *Tegula* grazing intensity decreased with increasing *Pisaster* density. Further, experimental *Pisaster* additions caused large reductions in *Tegula* grazing in areas with low background *Pisaster* density. Consistent with our field results, a laboratory experiment examining *Tegula* grazing and avoidance behavior under field-relevant *Pisaster* cue levels indicated decreases in grazing, and increases in avoidance behavior, with increasing cue density. Our results indicate that *Pisaster* NCEs on *Tegula* are density-dependent, and *Pisaster* density reductions reduce positive indirect effects on macroalgae, potentially affecting community structure. As *Pisaster* abundance begins to recover at some sites, our results highlight the importance of considering non-consumptive pathways when assessing the community-level impact of SSWD.","1.

The breakdown in the mutualism with coral reef species that occurs as a result of increasingly warmer ocean temperatures is a major threat to coral reefs around the globe. Given their short generation times, symbionts have been the focus of attempts at assisted evolution aimed at reef conservation. We found significant variation among algal genotypes in the species *Breviolum antillogorgium*, suggesting that laboratory selection experiments might produce phenotypes adapted to different water temperatures. However, 2 years (>500 generations) of laboratory selection at high temperature did not result in local adaptation to high temperatures associated with bleaching. Further, introduction of symbionts into polyp hosts greatly depressed the extent of genetic variation in photosynthetic rate. Mutualistic traits, such as growth rate and photosynthetic rate, measured in culture may not reflect the expression of those traits within hosts. This suggests that evolutionary rescue on natural reefs may take a considerable amount of time. Different rates of selection inside and outside of hosts means that efforts at assisted evolution will depend on how much of the algal life cycle occurs inside and outside of hosts.","California State University, Northridge","California State University, Northridge",University at Buffalo,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"terHorst, C.P.",,,,,NA,NA,"Brisson, C.","Coffroth, M.A.",,,,,,,3,Yes,Community Ecology,Special Topic: Science to Action on Changing Oceans,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,3,,Community Ecology,

The effects of bacteria on the photosynthetic and respiration rates of *B. antillogorgium* were dependent on the algal genotype from which the bacterial communities were sourced. Photosynthetic rates were higher in cultures with a greater concentration of Rhodobacterales (f).

Most studies on this topic have focused on documenting the response of corals to these warming events and tracking mortality and/or recovery. However, given that corals exist within a community of other benthic organisms that are all competing with one another for space, a more comprehensive view of community response (e.g., including turf, crustose coralline algae, and macroalgae) is needed. Palmyra Atoll, part of the Northern Line Islands in the central Pacific, is an ideal location to study global change in the absence of confounding local impacts such as fishing and pollution. Using permanent photoquadrats taken approximately annually at 8 sites from 2009-2017, we quantify spatial and temporal changes in benthic community composition, focusing on coral and algal species/genera and any other non-coral benthic taxa across both the 10m fore reef and the 5m reef terrace. Overall, our results show that benthic communities were structured differently among sites and between habitats; also, that at the time of disturbance there was a relative increase in turf and fleshy algal cover but that as of 2017, corals and calcifying algae had gradually reached pre-disturbance levels. Given that Palmyra and its surrounding coral reefs experienced mass bleaching associated with the 2015 global coral bleaching event, there is a unique opportunity to study patterns of recovery and mortality as well as to observe the natural stages of ecological succession after a disturbance.","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA, USA","Smithsonian Marine Station, Fort Pierce, FL, USA","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Khen, A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Carter, A.L.","Fox, M.D.","Johnson, M.D.","Smith, J.E.",,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,Special Topic: Taking the Long View,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,4,,Community Ecology,

Micropredators are parasite-like organisms that are smaller than their hosts or prey and feed on multiple hosts during a given life cycle. Unlike typical parasites, they spend much or most of their time free-living, associating only temporarily with hosts. In the ocean, micropredators can impact multiple fish species. Like any natural enemy, they are thought to both influence and be influenced by host behavior and distribution. Three common, but understudied, micropredators on subtidal rocky reefs in southern California belong to the families Cirolanidae, Cypridinidae, and Gnathiidae. To investigate spatio-temporal patterns of distribution and abundance, two substratum types (rock and sand), within two rocky reef sites, were sampled twice a month from May 2017-April 2018 using lighted benthic emergence traps. Over the course of the study, emergence traps captured a total of 8,277 micropredators, of which there were 5,978 cirolanids, 629 cypridinids, and 1,670 gnathiids. There was a significant difference in the abundance of each of the three families between sites, La Jolla and Point Loma. For all families, substratum was not a significant predictor of abundance. Cypridinids showed a significant seasonal trend, but only significant site x season interactions for cirolanids and gnathiids. These findings are likely a result of micropredator behavior, host distribution, and site-specific abiotic factors.","Department of Biology and Coastal and Marine Institute, San Diego State University","Department of Biology and Coastal and Marine Institute, San Diego State University","Department of Biological Sciences and Environmental Sciences Program, Arkansas State University",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Spitzer, C.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Anderson, T.W.","Sikkel, P.C.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,Population Biology and Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,4,,Community Ecology,

Kelp forest ecosystem stability and functional redundancy measured from these webs might depend on the level of aggregation in the network. Our objective was to provide a high-resolution topological kelp forest food web suitable for network analysis. 
     We defined the study system as rocky reef that supports giant kelp (*Macrocystis pyrifera*) in the Santa Barbara Channel. We constrained the food web to species regularly using the water column and benthic zones within kelp forests. The node list was assembled using information from primary literature, monitoring group species lists and surveys, technical reports, direct sampling, expert opinion, crowd sourced observations, and inference. Very rare species were only included if species were cryptic and/or unlikely to be detected by monitoring method, or high trophic level and transient, so naturally would be rare in the system. Diet links were assigned based on direct observation, literature, and, where data were sparse, logical inference.
     Increasing taxonomic resolution more than doubled the number of nodes in the web (relative to previously published webs) and dramatically increased the number of links. This greatly increased link density, richness, and connectance. Functional redundancy declined and nestedness increased among middle trophic levels. Maximum trophic level increased via improved resolution of mid-trophic levels, with the highest levels occupied by sharks, birds, and pinnipeds.","University of California, Santa Barbara",US Geological Survey,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Morton, Dana N",,,,,NA,NA,"Lafferty, Kevin",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,Ecosystem Assessment,Yes and I am a graduate student,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,4,,Community Ecology,

The effects of this alga’s presence on higher trophic levels, such as fish, is unknown. This study quantified the foraging rates of three common reef fishes (*Halichoeres semicinctus*, *Hypsypops rubicundus*, and *Semicossyphus pulcher*) that prey upon small epifauna associated with understory algae, including the invasive *S. horneri*. Foraging observations were made by scuba divers at six sites along the leeward side of Catalina Island. At all six sites, fishes foraged at higher rates among the native, *S. palmeri*, than the invasive *S. horneri*. Even at sites with low algal diversity, fishes still foraged at lower rates among *S. horneri*.  Our results suggest that the invasive *S. horneri* negatively impacts the foraging of native fishes, perhaps because of a low abundance of epifauna inhabiting this alga. These results suggest that the increasing prevalence of *S. horneri* on rocky reefs in Southern California and Baja California may impact higher trophic levels in invaded ecosystems.","California State University, Northridge","California State University, Northridge",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Scafidi, K.C.",,,,,NA,NA,"Steele, M.A.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,Ecosystem Assessment,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,Invasion Ecology,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,4,,Community Ecology,

The reasons behind this behavior can vary, and understanding what makes an individual have high site fidelity can help explain observed ecological patterns, such as habitat preference and species interactions, and inform management strategies. Reef fishes often have very high site fidelity, which allows for consistent access to food and shelter from predation. The site fidelity of lionfish, an invasive species in coral reef ecosystems, may reveal factors influencing the process of invasion, and provide useful information for management of lionfish invasion. This study quantified lionfish fidelity over a two-year period on 17 reefs varying in size, depth, habitat complexity and lionfish density near Eleuthera, the Bahamas.  Fidelity was defined as the frequency, duration, and spatial locations of individual lionfish, which were identified based on dorsal spine clipping or visual cues. Environmental covariates included density of lionfish, native grouper, and prey sized fish and measures of reef complexity. Lionfish density was the only variable that was significantly related to lionfish site fidelity, and lionfish density in turn was related to reef complexity. Site fidelity was inversely (but not significantly) related to prey density and not related to grouper density, reef complexity, lionfish size, or human disruption on the reef.

Low levels of disease were observed in the summers of 2015, 2016, and 2017.  Population levels following the epizootic remain stable but small, and shifted in size structure from larger to smaller stars. At one site, a dramatic increase in both juvenile and adult ochre stars occurred in 2017, giving hope for future recovery. In contrast, the most common subtidal species, the sunflower star, also suffered catastrophic mortality in 2014.

These models assume species within functional groups are similar in morphology and function, and thus predict they will respond similarly to key ecological drivers. We tested predictions of the Functional Group Model (FGM), a grouping for marine macroalgae widely used in both tropical and temperate systems to validate its underlying assumptions. The FGM predicts as morphological complexity increases, so will resistance to disturbance and herbivory due to greater thallus toughness. The FGM also predicts a tradeoff between morphological complexity and growth. To test predictions, we measured: 1) thallus toughness (force to penetrate), 2) tensile strength (force to break) and 3) relative growth for both tropical and temperate macroalgae from different functional groups. Penetration strength followed model predictions at the functional group level, though there was significant variability among species. The model did not predict tensile strength at any level for either tropical or temperate macroalgae. Further, relative growth did not align with predictions; rather it was highly variable between species and among functional groups. Thus, the underlying assumption that species within functional groups are more similar than between groups was violated, providing strong evidence that individual species need to be considered when predicting community responses to ecological drivers and challenging the usefulness of functional form groupings for marine macroalgae.","University of California, Los Angeles","California State University, Northridge","University of California, Los Angeles",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Ryznar, E.R.",,,,,NA,NA,"Fong, C.R.","Fong, P.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,5,,Community Ecology,

In contrast, chemical defenses were not altered by reef state for an ecologically hardy poritid coral or for a weedy pocilloporid coral. *Acropora millepora* that originated from or were transplanted into coral-dominated MPAs exhibited 46% and 36% increase, respectively, in inhibition of *V. coralliilyticus* relative to those that originated from or were transplanted into algal-dominated fished areas. *A. millepora* also exhibited historical reef effects on their microbial community composition, notably by persistently higher relative abundances of Vibrionaceae among individuals that originated from algal-dominated fished areas compared to individuals that originated from coral-dominated MPAs.

To address this gap, we conducted multi-choice feeding assays with the lined shore crab, *Pachygrapsus crassipes*- a consumer that has access to leaves and roots of two salt marsh plant species, cordgrass (*Spartina foliosa*) and pickleweed (*Sarcocornia pacifica*). We collected organisms from three sites in southern California (KF1, KF2, SDL) and three sites in northern California (BOL, TOM, BOD). In mesocosms, at Bodega Marine Lab and SDSU Coastal Marine Institute, shore crabs were offered both leaves and roots from the two plant species in cafeteria trials. Crab feeding preferences for plant species and plant tissues varied between sites at both small (< 25km) and large (> 800km) spatial scales. Because these data suggested site-specific patterns in cordgrass palatability, we compared the relative palatability of cordgrass leaves from multiple sites from within each region. Northern California crabs tended to prefer cordgrass leaves from BOD, regardless of crab source. Patterns from BOD suggest that preference for pickleweed relative to cordgrass may be due to an increase in pickleweed (roots) palatability. Overall, crab preference varied between plant tissue, species, and population.

However, the disease’s pathogen, *Labyrinthula zosterae* (Lz), is widespread and present in eelgrass beds in varied states of health. Understanding how this pathogen of a foundation species affects ecosystems in both negative and positive ways is imperative for a holistic view of its ecology. Based on high long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) production by relatives of Lz, we hypothesized that Lz similarly synthesized LCPUFA and, if confirmed, further posited that Lz may influence ecosystem production. Several LCPUFA, including docosahexaenoic acid or DHA, are considered to be essential molecules for most heterotrophs, which generally cannot synthesize these molecules de novo in biologically relevant amounts. By culturing isolates of Lz on both artificial and eelgrass-based substrates, we found that Lz synthesized significant amounts of DHA, a particularly important essential LCPUFA to many consumers. Our experiment showed that DHA is the most abundant FA by mass in Lz, which could indicate that eelgrass wasting disease plays a more nuanced and possibly positive role in seagrass-associated food webs than previously recognized. Our next steps are to investigate whether and how this production enters higher trophic levels in eelgrass ecosystems, highlighting an unrecognized potential for this destructive pathogen to also create.","Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, University of Oregon","Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, University of Oregon","Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, University of Oregon",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Yoshioka, R.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Schram, J.B.","Galloway, A.W.E.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,Speed Talk,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,5,,Community Ecology,

However, these models often ignore species interactions, which can regulate community composition and structure. To evaluate both direct and indirect effects of climate change on species distributions, we applied the Menge-Sutherland model, which describes the relative role of predation and environmental stress in regulating community structure. Using a space-for-time approach along a thermal gradient, we tested the predictions that predators are more strongly affected by increasing environmental stress than prey and that incorporating indirect (predator) effects increases our ability to predict impacts of increased temperature on prey distributions. We surveyed vertical distributions of predators (sea stars) and a foundational prey species (mussels) at 20 intertidal sites along the West Coast of the United States. Using generalized linear models and a structural equation model, we found that as temperature increased, the upper tide height limits of foundational prey species decreased (a direct effect) while the lower limits also shifted downward, due to an indirect effect on predator distributions. Under future climate change, mussel ranges may undergo a vertical shift towards the subtidal, allowing for localized persistence with implications for associated species. Our model comparisons indicate that incorporating both direct and indirect environmental stress effects can improve prediction of responses to warming.","University of California, Irvine","University of California, Irvine",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Wallingford, P.D.",,,,,NA,NA,"Sorte, C.J.B.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,Intertidal Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,5,,Community Ecology,

Stability, defined as variation in community composition through time, can be influenced by local factors like habitat size and regional processes like dispersal. Island biogeography theory (IBT) links local and regional processes, predicting that species richness positively and negatively correlates with island size and mainland distance respectively. Although IBT predicts species richness, it ignores species identity and abundance changes (i.e. community composition) that can occur during species turnover. Thus, the relationship among IBT and stability are unclear. Here we examine how IBT characteristics relate to fish and invertebrate temporal community stability across six coastal ponds. We plotted communities using nMDS, measuring their distance in ordination space to calculate stability via: convex hull area, mean year-to-year and mean year-to-centroid distance. Plotting instability metrics as a function of IBT characteristics, we found both negative and positive relationships of instability with pond size and ocean distance respectively. Lastly, we built a path analysis to look at the direct and indirect relationships of IBT on instability and found the total effect is driven through the direct relationship of pond size and distance, not through the IBT-species richness-instability path. This work extends the IBT framework to consider community composition through time, demonstrating that patch size and input distance can be used to predict stability.","Marine Science Center, Northeastern University","Marine Science Center, Northeastern University","Marine Science Center, Northeastern University",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Yeager, M.E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Gouhier, T.C.","Hughes, A.R.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,"Reproduction, Dispersal, and Recruitment",Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,community / stability,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,5,,Community Ecology,

In an effort to mitigate the documented negative impacts of such shoreline armoring, resources have been increasingly dedicated to restoration projects. In Washington State, management agencies have prioritized efforts to restore existing armored shorelines to their ‘natural’ unarmored state. The proximate effect of these restoration activities is beaches free of anthropogenic modifications. While both the proximate and broader impacts of restoration have been documented in beach and intertidal marine ecosystems, the closely linked nearshore subtidal ecosystem has received comparatively less attention. Our study addresses this knowledge gap by evaluating the effectiveness of shoreline restoration projects for fish communities that may not be directly dependent on beach habitat, with a focus on juvenile salmon and an important forage fish, Pacific herring. At six sites throughout Puget Sound, we surveyed fish assemblages and ecosystem characteristics along restored shorelines and nearby armored and natural shorelines. Lampara seine and snorkel surveys reveal substantial site and regional variability in fish community composition and abundance, with distinct seasonality in this variability, and provide an opportunity to examine landscape-scale spatial and temporal patterns in fish communities throughout Puget Sound.

Here we evaluate differences in top-down and bottom-up control on community recovery across depths. We investigate three mechanisms that could drive variation in recovery: 1) differences in recruitment of corals, 2) variation in growth and survival of recruits, and 3) variation in coral growth rates across depths. We found that the recruitment of new corals did not differ between depths, but that recruitment was significantly higher in the absence of herbivorous and corallivorous fishes. We reciprocally transplanted coral recruits between depths and found that recruit survival was significantly lower at 17m than 10m. We also examined recruit skeletal structure for physical damage and found that recruits at 17m were less likely to be intact and more likely to have disappeared completely than recruits at 10m. These results together suggest that top-down pressure is an important driver of coral recruitment, and that the negative effects of top-down pressure on coral recruits are stronger at 17m than 10m. Additionally, differences in growth and survival corals could contribute to variation in recovery rates. We will use a photoquadrat time series to compare coral growth and survival at 10m and 17m from 2011-2018.","University of California, Santa Barbara","University of California, Santa Barbara","University of California, Santa Barbara",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Speare, K.E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Clover, H.","Burkepile, D.E.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,"Reproduction, Dispersal, and Recruitment",Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,6,,Community Ecology,

However, our current understanding of the effects of climate change are confined to single species, single stressor studies. To gain a broader understanding of its impacts at the community level, it is critical to examine interactions between species under multiple stressors. To address this, we examined the effects of ocean acidification and hypoxia within giant kelp forest grazing communities of the California Current, systems that naturally experience low pH and oxygen due to upwelling. We measured grazing impacts on cultured juvenile giant kelp, an important foundation species, across four species of invertebrate grazers under the two stressors in lab experiments. Species differed in their grazing impacts, but overall, hypoxia negatively impacted grazing more than acidification across all four species, suggesting that hypoxia can drive changes in feeding behavior even over short timeframes. To extrapolate to population level impacts on juvenile kelp, we integrated field and literature data with results from the lab experiments and found that an often overlooked grazing species, the brown turban snail (*Chlorostoma brunnea*), emerges as a dominant grazer due to its high natural densities and high grazing impact even under predicted future scenarios.

We used these urchin barrens to help estimate the impact of kelp loss to the diets of nearshore and offshore marine communities. We collected tissues and estimated stable isotope values (carbon d^13^C, a proxy for food source, and nitrogen d^15^N, a proxy for trophic level) from the base of the food web and consumers within kelp forests, urchin barrens, and offshore areas across 9 islands. We characterized the base of the Aleutian Island food web using nearshore and offshore filtered seawater for phytoplankton, green and coralline algae from urchin barrens and kelp forests, and kelp from kelp forest habitat. Variation in stable isotope values for primary producers between habitats and across space suggests food web studies should consider small- and large-scale spatial variation in stable isotope values of food web sources as these will alter dietary estimates from mixing models. Nitrogen stable isotope values from green urchins at one island increased from kelp forests to urchin barrens to offshore areas. This suggests across habitats green urchins may receive different food sources, they may increase frequency of cannibalism, consumption of consumers or microbes, and/or starvation.","Coastal and Marine Institute, San Diego State University","Coastal and Marine Institute, San Diego State University",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Gabara, S.S.",,,,,NA,NA,"Edwards, M.S.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,Ecosystem Assessment,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,6,,Community Ecology,

For example, barrens and forests span large (>100m) spatial scales in the Channel Islands of California, but occur in distinct bands along the coast in New Zealand, with shallow barrens adjoining forests at greater depths. These differences in community scales can arise from differences in the characteristic scales of either environmental heterogeneity or species interactions. We quantify the extent to which environmental variation versus scale-specific feedbacks in urchin grazing behavior explain the different community scales by comparing the fit of dynamical models incorporating each feature to field data. Differences in behavior best explained the differences in community scales, with models most consistent with data differing in the scale of grazing feedbacks among regions. Specifically, our results suggest that in California, urchins actively graze across large scales (>100m) when low kelp densities and high urchin densities lead to insufficient subsidy of drift kelp. By contrast, in New Zealand, our results suggest that urchins actively graze wherever kelp densities are insufficient to physically deter urchins; these local (1-5m) feedbacks combine with depth gradients in wave stress on kelp to produce banded community regimes along the coast. This shows that when consumer behavior mediates the scale of strong species interactions, it may also govern larger-scale community patterns.",UC Davis,UC Davis,National Park Service,University of Auckland,UC Santa Barbara,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Karatayev, V.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Baskett, M.L.","Kushner, D.J.","Shears, N.T.","Caselle, J.E.",,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Community Ecology,Behavioral Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,6,,Community Ecology,

During this study (2014–2018), Hurricanes Irma and Maria (9/2017) reduced mean octocoral densities on shallow reefs at two sites in St John, US Virgin Islands, by ~33%. Decomposition of this effect among the three most common species, *Antillogorgia americana*, Eunicea flexuosa, and *Gorgonia ventalina*, revealed insight into the role of octocoral diversity in this system (where 35 species are found). The recent hurricanes did not affect the annual mortality of E. flexuosa, but increased mortality of *A. americana* and *G. ventalina*, demonstrating heterogeneity in the impacts of physical disturbance among species. Analysis of the timing and mode of action of mortality revealed that the storm effects were delayed (occurring from 11/2017 to 8/2018), and disproportionately affected small (5–10 cm tall) versus larger (> 10 cm tall) colonies. Despite these changes, average octocoral height and densities in 2018 remained above levels recently shown to be effective at providing habitat to demersal fishes. This outcome suggests there is functional redundancy among octocoral species in delivering at least one ecosystem service.",California State University Northridge,Observatoire Oceanologique Banyuls sur Mer,California State University Northridge,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Tsounis, Georgios",,,,,NA,NA,Lorenzo Bramanti,Peter J.

Subtidal surveys (0-20m depths) show that record numbers of purple sea urchins observed in 2014 – 2018 were the result of successful recruitment, and were associated with severe damage to both fleshy and calcified algal species. Counter to the prevailing paradigm, crustose coralline algal cover in these urchin barrens has decreased substantially, and bare rock is commonly observed in areas dominated by purple urchins. The gut contents of purple urchins reveals a diverse poor-quality diet, including coralline algae, sand, sponge, barnacles, and meat (possibly abalone).  Despite the poor diet, the purple urchins are developing sufficient gonad to reproduce, with a strong recruitment pulse apparent in the 2018 surveys.  Although some individuals show signs of stress (spine loss, balding), the purple urchin population as a whole remains persistent, and has expanded into deeper habitats than historically observed.  The predatory seastar, *Pycnopodia*, remained absent in recent surveys. Restoration actions to support broad-scale bull kelp recovery in northern California are being developed by KELPRR, a broad coalition of scientists, stakeholders, and resource managers dedicated to enhancing the future resilience of these valuable bull kelp forests to climate change impacts.","California Department of Fish and Wildlife

Reef Check California’s (RCCA) ongoing long-term monitoring (2007-2018) documents the rapid transition from bull kelp forest to urchin barren along this coastline. Since 2014, this region has experienced a steady increase in purple urchin (*Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*) densities, and a massive decline in bull kelp (*Nereocystis luetkeana*), understory algae and red abalone (*Haliotis rufescens*) densities. The widely reported sea star wasting disease caused sea star densities to plummet in 2013, and by 2014 predatory sunflower stars (*Pycnopodia helianthoides*) were ecologically extinct from the system. Shortly thereafter, purple urchin densities exploded. At RCCA long-term sites in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties, urchin densities increased from an average of 0.17/m^2 in the years prior to 2014 to an average of 18.38/m^2 in 2018. Subsequent to the emergence of the urchin barrens, red abalone populations collapsed. By 2017, abalone densities at RCCA sites in Mendocino County had declined to about 60%, and in Sonoma County to about 25% of the densities found prior to the loss of the kelp forest. This decline led to the closure of the recreational red abalone fishery in 2017. In 2018, abalone densities have continued to decline further to about 30% of the pre-2014 densities in Mendocino County and to about 5% in Sonoma County.

Here we explore the spatial and temporal patterns of kelp forest fish communities along the Baja California Peninsula, sampling 17 sites along a latitudinal extension of more than 450 km. A total of 77 species in 33 families were recorded through visual censuses. Even though a latitudinal pattern in the species richness was not evident, the communities farther south had higher species richness. The ANOSIM analysis corroborated that significant differences exist between the 17 sites, with a global value of R = 0.672 (P <0.001), with no geographical distance relationship. Furthermore, the composition of the communities showed little interannual variation.

Examples from marine ecosystems include the rocky outer shoreline of the western US, where the keystone predator *Pisaster ochraceus* maintains the diversity of the sessile intertidal community by preying on competitively dominant mussels. What affect do alternative prey have on the predation pressure of sea stars on these mussels? In this study, we address this question in three stages. First, comprehensive community surveys were taken to identify and count the proportion of potential prey in the field. Second, all *P. ochraceus* within the sites were counted and measured, then flipped over to identify and record any prey items being consumed. This diet study differed from previous studies in that stars were surveyed via snorkel within a fixed, narrow range of tide heights at different points in the tidal cycle throughout the survey period. Comparing food availability to observed prey proportions may allow for the calculation of electivity coefficients for these populations. Finally, field manipulations of prey community composition in the field will allow us to measure any changes in predation pressure on mussels by *P. ochraceus*.

Offshore ecosystems in particular raise unique challenges in that regular and broad spatio--temporal sampling is infeasible. Using biological and oceanographic data collected from an annual summer oceanic shipboard survey, the NOAA Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Survey, and complementary output from a Regional Ocean Modeling System, we explore the relationships between marine mammal sightings, mid-trophic-level observations, and environmental variables within Central California waters from 1996 to 2016. By integrating sampling of multiple trophic levels within a singular survey design, it is possible to compare the variability in community assemblage while accounting for differences in space and time. We find that variability in predator species richness tracks that of oceanographic conditions and their prey, particularly during the anomalous sea surface temperature anomalies of the 2015 ""Blob"".

We used Autonomous Reef-Monitoring Structures (ARMS; oceanarms.org) to assess how kelps influence patterns of early successional community structure in benthic rocky reef communities in Central British Columbia, Canada. We placed ARMS (n=12) in urchin barrens and in forests dominated by *Macrocystis pyrifera* or *Nereocystis luetkeana* for ten months around the Calvert Ecological Observatory. Abundance of large mobile taxa, cover of sessile taxa, and metabarcoding of mobile and sessile assemblages revealed similar patterns across sites and habitat types. We found weak community dissimilarity between urchin barren and kelp habitats across focal community components, and we found little differentiation between the communities dominated by the two canopy-forming kelps. We found a high degree of compositional overlap between communities developing on ARMS, as expected for highly connected subtidal reef systems. The greatest source of variation in community composition was related to the spatial arrangement of sites, potentially revealing how environmental gradients at a scale larger than transitions between foundation species but within the same general habitat influences community structure in this region.","Hakai Insitute, University of British Columbia","Hakai Insitute, University of British Columbia","Hakai Insitute, University of British Columbia",Florida Museum of Natural History,,,,,,,,,,,,"Whalen, M.

Many species of fish and invertebrates reply upon kelp habitats for foraging and refuge from predation. Kelp, especially bull kelp (*Nereocystis luetkeana*), is of particular importance as habitat for Young-of-Year (YOY) and juvenile rockfish. Total rockfish abundance in Washington has declined approximately 70 percent in the last 40 years. In particular, yelloweye (*Sebastes ruberrimus*) and Bocaccio (*S. paucispinus*) have declined to a point of being listed respectively as threatened and endangered. The Rockfish Recovery Plan for both species was finalized in 2017, and outlines management actions and research programs to fill data gaps and develop monitoring programs to assess conservation and survival of the species. Specific conservation goals for nearshore and benthic habitat improvement include a collaborative effort to develop a Kelp Recovery Plan. Through a two-year process NOAA and the Northwest Straits Initiative have conducted a series of kelp workshops to address data gaps, compile existing literature and research, and draft the plan. Scientists from agency, tribal, and non-profit groups are working together to address key issues. These efforts also include kelp monitoring surveys by kayak, satellite, and scuba.

The majority of restorations to date have been deemed unsuccessful. While many cite the scale of the restoration as cause of failure others call for a need to ameliorate the local environmental or biological stressors prohibiting the successful establishment of targeted transplants or seeding. Elkhorn Slough, a highly eutrophic system suffered massive seagrass (*Zostera marina*) loss in the mid 1900s. Beginning in 1980 Elkhorn Slough seagrass beds have been naturally recovering to what is today a 10 hectare deficit of its historical extent. Unfortunately the rate of recovery has plateaued in recent years. To promote local seagrass recovery and look at the role of ephemeral macroalgae we conducted three small-scale experimental restorations in 2015, ‘16 and ‘18 that explored the effect of time of year, initial plot size and initial shoot length on restoration success. In total we have restored over 1825m^2 of seagrass habitat; a noteworthy accomplishment considering initial plot size was 0.5m^2 (n=100), 0.25m^2 (n=4) and 1m^2 (n=4). Our results have also demonstrated that a) restoration can significantly enhance local biodiversity relative to adjacent mudflat and b) community composition of critical mesograzers in restored plots mirror that of existing natural beds. Despite eutrophication and other anthropogenic stressors, restoration in Elkhorn Slough was possible, making it a model system for future restorations along the West Coast where restoring conditions conducive to natural seagrass recovery are unlikely.","University of California, Santa Cruz",Sonoma State University,San Francisco State University,"University of California, Santa Cruz","University of California, Santa Cruz",,,,,NA,NA,Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve,,,,"Beheshti, K.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Hughes, B.","Boyer, K.","Clemons, A.K.","Emery, M.","Wasson, K.",,,,6,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Conservation and Restoration,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,8,,Conservation and Restoration,

Polydorids present a threat to both animal health and aesthetic quality in molluscan aquaculture, but are a difficult pest to eradicate without damaging the abalone host. Developing an effective and efficient method to manage polydorid pests could massively benefit captive populations in research and farm settings. We applied a series of beeswax coatings to the external shell of 25 red abalone (*Haliotis rufescens*) with intention of complete polydorid elimination. Eradication of polydorid worms in the smaller abalone size class (comprised of 10 individuals), occurred in just nine weeks, but the larger size class (comprised of 15 individuals), required a lengthier, more intensive process. Polydorid worms exhibited highly variable emergence behavior, complicating monitoring and counts. This waxing method appears to be an efficacious management solution for polydorid worms and epibionts in aquaculture of calcifying molluscs, with possibility of complete eradication dependent on rigor of application and monitoring.","CDFW Shellfish Health Laboratory, UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay, CA 94923","CDFW Shellfish Health Laboratory, UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay, CA 94923","CDFW Shellfish Health Laboratory, UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay, CA 94923",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Loeher, Malina M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Moore, James D.","Marshman, Blythe C.",,,,,,,3,No,Conservation and Restoration,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,8,,Conservation and Restoration,

This is particularly true for wild meat hunting in tropical forests. Unlike other global biodiversity threats like deforestation or overfishing, hunting distribution maps are typically built on small scales from coarse proxies of landscape accessibility and are rarely validated with empirical data. Armed with only freely available geospatial data, we applied circuit-theoretic connectivity models to predict the distribution of wild hunting effort in tropical forests across Malaysian Borneo. We then validated how well our predictions matched real-world observations of hunting activity collected from infrared camera traps. Despite the scarcity of on-the-ground hunting data, our novel connectivity-based approach to threat mapping was strongly correlated with hunting effort. By comparison, commonly used proxies of hunter activity naïve to habitat complexity were poor approximations of real-world hunting.

In 2013, E/K began to decline in the Bay at unmanaged sites, raising questions as to what the causes of the decline were. E/K continued to decline into 2017 and remains sparse in the Bay today. The aim of this study was to evaluate 1) the extent and timing of the E/K cover decline in the Bay, and 2) evaluate the possible drivers including environmental, ecological, and management factors. We considered a wide range of variables in a generalized additive mixed model and used model selection to determine the best model and most important predictors of macroalgae cover over time. Results confirm a significant decline in E/K in the bay beginning in August 2013, and cover remained below 6 % after 2016. The major drivers of E/K percent cover decline over time were herbivorous fish biomass, and stream discharge flow rates.

Nowhere may this be as dramatic as in the coastal zones of the Aleutian Archipelago where large declines in forest-forming kelps have occurred in recent decades due to a dramatic increase in sea urchin abundances. We studied patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem production in small isolated kelp forests, urchin barren grounds, and in areas that were in the transition between the two states at 10 islands during 2016 and 2017. Specifically, we deployed replicate benthic respiration chambers in each habitat to measure oxygen production/consumption over 24-hour periods, and conducted shipboard respiration measurements of the dominant organisms in each habitat to estimate their contribution to NEP.  Our results show that that the loss of kelp forests resulted in decreased biodiversity and an overall reduction in gross primary production across the Archipelago. Nighttime respiration rates were greater in the kelp forests due to higher abundances of organisms indicating that the effects of kelp loss on ecosystem production varied over the diurnal cycle. The transition areas exhibited intermediate levels of these metrics.  Further, these patterns varied among islands and regions of the Archipelago, presumably due to differences in light (cloud cover) and ocean conditions (salinity and temperature), such as observed on the opposing sides of biogeographic breaks.",San Diego State University,University of Alaska Fairbanks,San Diego State University,San Diego State University,San Diego State University,,,,,NA,NA,San Diego State University,San Diego State University,,,"Edwards, M.S.",,,,,NA,NA,"Konar, B.","Gabara, S.","Sullaway, G,","McHugh, T.","Spector, M.","Small, S.",,,7,Yes,Ecosystem Assessment,Community Ecology,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,36,,Ecosystem Assessment,

The goal of this study is to quantify differences in benthic algal biomass and net community production (NCP) on temperate rocky reefs that have been denuded of canopy forming kelps, and how these differences vary with latitude. Laboratory experiments coupling algal biomass with rates of net productivity (i.e. the difference between gross primary production and respiration) were conducted to construct a model of benthic productivity. Using sea water dissolved oxygen as a proxy, this model was then compared to sensor deployments to assess the viability of only deploying sensors (i.e. MiniDOTs®) to assess NCP on temperate rocky reefs. We found a significant difference between algal biomass and diversity on reefs dominated by the canopy forming kelp, *Macrosytis pyrifera*, and adjacent reefs denuded of *M. pyrifera*. Further, we found that only deploying MiniDOTs® was not enough to quantify differences in NCP on reefs with and without a canopy forming kelp. Understanding differences in algal biomass and ecophysiology (photosynthetic parameters) may be a better predictor of overall NCP on temperate rocky reefs.

Estuaries can be greatly affected by anthropogenic disturbances, but the subsequent effects of these disturbances remain under studied. Many anthropogenic stressors contribute to dramatic changes in the ecological structure of these environments, especially enhanced supplies of nutrients that cause algal blooms and altered hydrology that can result in variation in oceanic flushing. We conducted a mesocosm experiment modeling an estuary subject to nutrient-stimulated algal blooms where we manipulated flushing regimes. Regimes were either daily flushing or never flushed representing a closed estuary. Mesocosms were filled with natural sediment, water collected from a local estuary, and enough macroalgae to simulate an algal bloom. After 3 weeks, the algae started to decompose in all mesocosms. However, flushing reduced acidification as pH decreased 3% in the flushed mesocosm and 8% in the unflushed mesocosms. Thus, the rate at which an estuary is flushed by oceanic water is an important factor to consider for nutrient-driven acidification. With the projection of acidity to increase 100 to 150% over preindustrial levels in the next 75 years, anthropogenic factors such as increased nutrient supplies and altered hydrology will only add to these predictions.",UCLA,UCLA,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Moore, T.N.",,,,,NA,NA,"Fong, P",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Ecosystem Assessment,Community Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,36,,Ecosystem Assessment,

Researchers have long proposed that calcification protects coralline algae from being consumed by herbivores. However, corallines differ in their natural susceptibility to grazing, confusing the true benefit of calcium carbonate. Moreover, as oceans become more acidic, the ability of corallines to calcify may be compromised. In this study, we investigated how herbivory rates would change if corallines become less calcified in the future. We decalcified two species of articulated coralline algae to varying degrees using serial dilutions of acid and fed them to the purple urchin *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*, hypothesizing that herbivory would increase in response to calcium carbonate depletion.  In one coarsely branched species (*Calliarthron tuberculosum*), reduced calcium carbonate content increased consumption by sea urchins, but only after 50% reduction in CaCO~3~. However, the finely-branched species (*Corallina vancouveriensis*) was indiscriminately devoured by urchins, regardless of calcium carbonate content.  We conclude that the herbivory-reducing benefits of calcification are species specific and likely intertwined with morphology. Compromised calcification will not necessarily increase herbivory on corallines in our future oceans.","Botany Department and Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver BC","Bamfield Marine Sciences Center, Bamfield BC","Hakai Institute, Calvert Island BC","Botany Department and Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver BC",,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Huber, S.R.",,,,,NA,NA,"Eastham, T.","Froese, T.","Martone, P.T.",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Intertidal Ecology,Ecosystem Assessment,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,36,,Ecosystem Assessment,

These environmental conditions can be accompanied by unanticipated shifts in community structure, or tipping points, such as from kelp forests to sea urchin barrens.  Sea urchin barrens with radical reductions in algal food, and abalone numbers have caused major disruptions in abalone fishery and restoration planning. The density based harvest control rules however in the red abalone *Haliotis rufescens* fishery management plan have been informative due to their reliance on up to date fishery independent density information. Recent data in 2016 and 2017 led the Fish and Game Commission to close the fishery in 2018. The shift to purple sea urchin * Strongylocentrotus purpuratus* barrens has also impacted other abalone in northern abalone, such as pinto abalone, *H. kamtschatkana*.  In central and southern California many sites are now dominated by purple sea urchins. The endangered white abalone, *H. sorenseni*, rare in southern California is now worse off due to algal declines in some areas near Los Angeles and San Diego making a bad situation worse. Restoration plans will need to incorporate the results of recent surveys as well as select sites that provide refuge from warm, low oxygen water, maintain algal food resources and minimize purple sea urchins. Current environmental and biological data will be important for building adaptive management and restoration strategies for California’s rapidly changing ocean.","Karen C.

They can form extensive aggregations up to 500 individuals within a range of 2-3 meters in the intertidal. These anemones experience dramatic temperature fluctuations both daily and seasonally. For example, during the summer months an anemone’s internal body temperature can change 20°C or more as the tide changes. This contrast in environmental susceptibility draws into question the mechanism through which these organisms are able to survive. In this study, we collected over 500 anemones across 60 genotypes from the Oregon coast and subjected individuals to either control (12°C) or heat-stress conditions (23°C) for two weeks. Bleaching responses of all anemones were quantified and combined with genome-wide SNP genotyping to estimate heritability and test for associations between thermal tolerance and genotypes. Using the linkage map and draft genome assembly for this species, we searched for genomic regions underlying variation within more thermally tolerant phenotypes. We profiled transcriptional responses in anemones with contrasting phenotypes, to evaluate whether genomic regions associated with tolerance include genes differentially expressed in heat-tolerant and susceptible genotypes. Integrating genomic and transcriptomic data with quantitative genetic analysis provides a new perspective on the mechanistic basis for thermal tolerance phenotypes and the potential for adaptation to an incredibly variable intertidal environment.",Oregon State University,Oregon State University,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Dziedzic, K.E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Meyer, E.",,,,,,,,2,No,Evolutionary Biology,Intertidal Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,9,,Evolutionary Biology,

However, the lack of a robust understanding of kelp phylogeny, with corresponding clade divergence time estimates, has limited our understanding of their origin and subsequent diversification. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary diversification of habitat-forming kelps using a global genus-level phylogeny inferred primarily from organellar genome data sets, and investigate the timing of kelp radiation using fossil and biogeographical calibrations. We resolve several important features of their phylogeny, including relationships among the morphologically simple kelp families (sometimes viewed as “ancestral”) and the broader radiation of complex kelps, demonstrating that the initial radiation of the latter resulted from an increase in speciation rate around the time of the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. This burst in speciation rate is consistent with a possible role of recent climatic cooling in triggering the kelp radiation and predates the origin of sea otters and other benthic-foraging carnivores. Historical biogeographical reconstructions point to a northeast Pacific origin of complex kelps, with subsequent colonization of new habitats likely playing an important role in driving their ecological diversification.

Differences in genicular development and tissue properties between articulated clades, however, suggest that there is more than one way to achieve this function. Chemical composition of the cell wall plays a role in both the decalcification process that is integral to genicular development, and the mechanical properties of the genicular tissue; we therefore investigated whether the content and identity of polysaccharides in genicular tissue would differ between articulated clades. We also analysed the chemical composition of intergenicular tissues and closely related crustose species, to see whether phylogenetic relationships could predict cell wall chemistry of calcified tissue across different coralline morphologies. Data presented here suggests that developmental and mechanical differences are underscored by differences in genicular cell wall chemistry; conversely, chemical similarity between calcified tissues across both articulated and crustose species suggests that little has changed in the cell wall of these tissues over the course of evolution.","University of British Columbia, Canada","University of British Columbia and Beaty Biodiversity Centre, Canada",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Janot, K.G.",,,,,NA,NA,"Martone, P.T.",,,,,,,,2,No,Evolutionary Biology,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,9,,Evolutionary Biology,

The current management of reef fishes in Hawaii includes two pooled taxa: the parrotfishes (Labridae, Scarinae: 7 species) and a “Deep-7” bottomfish complex of six species of eteline snappers and one species of grouper. Recent research on growth, maturation, and longevities for major species in both taxa indicate that these complexes contain species with disparate life histories. These range from fast to very fast growth and maturation and short to moderate longevities among the parrotfishes, and from moderate to very slow growth and maturation and long to very long lifespans in the bottomfishes. Despite greater variation in life-history traits among the bottomfishes (the “ugly” complex) than the parrotfishes (the “bad”), the great functional importance of some excavator parrotfishes complicates their management as a complex. Species complexes need be evaluated case-by-case, carefully considering the type of fishery (specific gear type), details of catch records, and the extent and quality of life-history and other fishery-independent data available for component species. Although pooling species is a tempting default option in data-poor situations, at its worst it is only better than unregulated take. At its best it is a necessary evil that should be avoided when sufficient data on species’ demographics are available, especially when the ecosystem consequences of overfishing habitat engineers is involved.","University of Hawaii, Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology",,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"DeMartini, E.E.",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,1,No,Fisheries Ecology,Special Topic: Science to Action on Changing Oceans,,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,10,,Fisheries Ecology,

Pollock also play an integral role in the food web, serving as essential prey for many economically important species. Intense predation pressure, however, has negatively impacted size and age structures of pollock in the Gulf of Alaska. Quantifying variation in pollock consumption by major groundfish predators would improve our understanding about the population dynamics of this species. Using data provided by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (NOAA; 1990 to 2017) and International Pacific Halibut Commission, we calculated spatial and temporal indices of predation on Gulf of Alaska pollock, accounting for variation in consumption by Arrowtooth Flounder (Atheresthes stomias), Pacific Cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Pacific Halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), and adult Walleye Pollock. We combined assessment-based estimates of predator biomass, relative predator densities, annual rations, and proportions of pollock consumed to approximate predation intensity by year and location. Predation indices were computed across a uniform grid that spanned the region. We anticipate that time-varying indices of predation will benefit the stock assessment for Gulf of Alaska pollock by serving as a modifier of constant natural mortality. Furthermore, estimates of predation intensity at local, regional, and basin scales inform us about how trophic interactions may be interpreted differently based on the scale of our observations.","College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, University of Alaska Fairbanks","College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, University of Alaska Fairbanks","Status of Stocks and Multispecies Assessment Program, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA","Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Modeling Program, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA",,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Barnes, Cheryl.L",,,,,NA,NA,"Beaudreau, Anne.H","Dorn, Martin.H","Holsman, Kirstin.H",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Fisheries Ecology,Applied Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,10,,Fisheries Ecology,

Because fishing can drastically impact fish populations, we hypothesized that MPAs placed in areas with heavy fishing pressure prior to protection will have greater and faster changes in fish populations following protection. Using a diver operated stereo-video camera system, we compared sizes and density of fishes targeted by anglers within MPAs to nearby comparison areas (non-MPAs). The MPAs in this study were established in 2012, allowing us to evaluate initial effects of protection. We used California Recreational Fisheries Survey data to determine levels of fishing pressure within each MPA prior to protection. We did not detect any relationship between differences in densities (MPA – non-MPA) and the amount of past fishing pressure. However, differences in average sizes and size distributions of targeted fishes were predicted by past fishing pressure. Depending on the biological metric used, the historical fishing pressure of an area can impact the efficacy of MPAs, and should be considered when predicting and evaluating MPA performance.","California State University, Northridge","California State University, Northridge",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Jaco, E.

The middle rocky intertidal zone of southern California is often dominated by an articulated coralline/red algal turf, which serves as an important microhabitat for a diversity of invertebrate meiofauna. This community can be subjected to pulse disturbances, such as sand burial or boulder movement, which remove the turf community, requiring regrowth and subsequent recovery. The goal of this experiment was to examine the recovery rates of coralline turfs, and their associated meiofauna, following a simulated disturbance in which plots were cleared of the upright turf but with the encrusting, basal portion left behind. In addition, clearing was conducted during an ENSO period in 2016 and during a non-ENSO period in 2017 to compare differences in recovery rates initiated under differing oceanographic regimes. Recovery of algal cover, turf thickness, and associated meiofauna was determined through comparisons with non-manipulated controls. Recovery of the algal turf was slower than expected (ca. 16 months for turf thickness) with no clear differences in recovery trajectories between the two experimental periods. Recovery of the turf-associated meiofauna is currently being examined to determine if it recovers concurrently with turfs or whether there is a delayed response. The slow recovery rates of this dominant microhabitat forming algal turf suggest disturbances can have lasting effects on the structure of rocky intertidal communities.","Biological Sciences Department, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, CA 91768","Biological Sciences Department, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, CA 91768",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Agler, S.T.",,,,,NA,NA,"Smith, J.R.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Intertidal Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,11,,Intertidal Ecology,

In intertidal systems, temperature and pH can drive intraspecific trait variation and lead to regional trait differences that affect species interactions. In west coast intertidal zones,* Nucella* dogwhelks are drilling predators of the habitat-forming mussel *Mytilus californianus*. Dogwhelks are known to exhibit local adaptation and show selectivity for prey, but it is not known how environment or ancestry contribute to variation in drilling. We conducted an observational study across eight intertidal sites in OR and CA to determine what environmental conditions correlate with drilling behavior. At each site we measured the length of dogwhelk-drilled mussels and used linear mixed effects models to relate this to measurements of temperature and pH. We also sequenced dogwhelks at COI to examine genetic relationships. Our results show that dogwhelks are selective for larger mussels and the mean length of drilled mussels varies among sites. A linear mixed effects model shows more stable temperature and pH is positively correlated with mussel size drilled. There was no significant effect of genetic relatedness on drilling behavior. These results show climate variability is the dominant factor shaping intraspecific variation in drilling behavior, suggesting the potential for rapid changes in drilling traits and ecological interactions as coastal climates change.",University of California Santa Cruz,University of California Santa Cruz,University of California Santa Cruz,University of California Santa Cruz,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Contolini, G.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Palkovacs, E.P.","Raimondi, P.T.","Reid, K.",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Intertidal Ecology,Evolutionary Biology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,11,,Intertidal Ecology,

To better understand the ecological consequences of *Pisaster* declines through non-consumptive effects (NCEs) on prey, we asked whether *Pisaster* and other predators, namely crabs and octopuses, could regulate the grazing and growth of an abundant herbivorous snail (*Tegula funebralis*) on California rocky shores . In laboratory experiments, *Tegula* exposed to *Pisaster* risk cues increased their avoidance behavior, decreased grazing, and grew less, relative to control cues. In contrast, *Tegula* exposed to cues from either crabs or octopus exhibited little to no avoidance behavior, and grazed and grew to the same extent as control snails. In treatments where predator chemical cues were combined, *Tegula* exhibited avoidance behavior only when *Pisaster* cues were present. In support of our lab results, field surveys revealed strong correlations between *Tegula* vertical distribution (a result of anti-predator behavior) and *Pisaster* abundance, but not with the abundance of crabs, octopus, or other sea stars. Together, our results provide evidence that *Pisaster* presence matters more than a diverse predator assemblage for initiating NCEs on *Tegula* grazing, growth, and vertical distribution. Thus, areas heavily impacted by SSWD could see shifts in *Tegula* vertical distribution and an increase in herbivorous grazing due to decreases in abundance of this potential keystone intimidator.",Humboldt State University,Humboldt State University,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Murie, K.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Bourdeau, P.E.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Intertidal Ecology,Behavioral Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,11,,Intertidal Ecology,

Ecological strategies, such as bet-hedging, are manifest through traits including morphology, reproductive mode and ploidy (through its effect on genetic diversity). Many macroalgae inhabiting littoral zones possess complex life cycles that include asexual stages as well as sexual generations that differ in morphology and ploidy. We studied populations of *Mastocarpus* along the central coast of California to test three hypotheses about the elasticity and resilience to disturbance of the different morphologies, reproductive modes and generations: (1) upright frond stages would colonize more rapidly and be more abundant than crustose sporophytes, (2) frond domination would result from more rapid colonization by asexual female fronds than by sexual stages, and (3) sexual and asexual diploid stages would colonize more rapidly than sexual haploid stages due to their phenology relative to the timing of the disturbance. In our plots, we found settlement of crustose individuals prior to upright individuals, high crustose coverage which was eventually matched by frond cover due to a rapid appearance of indeterminable juvenile plants, and no relationship between diploid individuals and plot recovery. These results suggest that reproductive mode and ploidy play a lesser role in recovery, and morphological traits which provide resistance to disturbance grant the highest recovery success.","California State University, Northridge","California State University, Northridge",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Pujdak, C.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Dudgeon, S.R.",,,,,,,,2,Yes,Intertidal Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,11,,Intertidal Ecology,

Different life stages of marine invertebrates may have different vulnerability to thermal stress due to varying physiological ability to tolerate environmental stress (sensitivity, a function of prior selection and acclimation events) and experience unequal levels of environmental stress due to differences in habitat use (exposure). We studied intertidal California mussels (*Mytilus californianus*) at two sites in southern California to test the hypotheses that habitat use differs across life stages of marine invertebrates and differences in thermal tolerance occur due to environmental filtering. Across four microhabitats (solitary, aggregate, shelter and tidepool), we documented the distribution and thermal thresholds of juvenile and adult mussels across microhabitats, and the thermal conditions they are exposed to.Thermal conditions and occupancy differed across microhabitats while thermal tolerance differed between life stages but not microhabitats. In sum, juveniles had lower thermal limits than adults and were more likely to experience conditions that exceeded these limits, making them most vulnerable to extreme heat events. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple life stages and microhabitats to predict the effects of climate change on intertidal invertebrates.","University of California, Irvine","University of California, Irvine",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Pandori, L.L.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Sorte, C.J.B.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Intertidal Ecology,Population Biology and Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,12,,Intertidal Ecology,

In order to explore the relative importance of these trophic pressures in comparison to environmental drivers, we quantified intertidal zonation and size and density of mobile invertebrates at 25 semi-protected rocky beaches in Southeast Alaska. In our study region on the west coast of Prince of Wales Island, both humans and sea otters (*Enhydra lutris*) prey on intertidal invertebrates, including pinto abalone (*Haliotis kamtschatkana*) and black katy chiton (*Katharina tunicata*). Our study sites vary in length of time since sea otter recolonization and distance from human communities as well as environmental factors, such as slope, aspect, exposure, and substrate.  We hypothesized that an increase in sea otter occupation time, proximity to town, wave exposure, slope, and a decrease in substrate rugosity will decrease mobile invertebrate abundance.  Preliminary observations suggest that pinto abalone abundance is heavily depleted at all sites and that black katy chiton abundance increases with substrate rugosity.

By the time they reach harvestable size, there are often <10. What are the major sources of these very large losses? We manipulated predator access and substrate type at 4 beaches around the inland waters of Washington that varied in salinity, crab abundance, and other parameters. Juvenile Manila clams of 2 size classes were stained and outplanted in experimental units at 2 tidal elevations, and allowed to grow over one summer. Growth rates were extremely variable among individuals, although larger (initially 6mm) clams grew more than 3mm clams. Growth at most sites and both elevations were similar except at one site with much slower growth. This site also had the poorest survival overall, and many clams were found dead but intact after 2 months. Preventing predator access with mesh tops improved survival at some sites (by up to 74%) but not others, with some of this variation attributable to crab densities. Salinities varied among sites but did not affect survival or growth. The site with poor survival and growth had high porewater temperatures that did not cool down overnight, likely due to local bathymetry. The abiotic data suggest that under certain contexts, tolerance thresholds may be exceeded during a few sequential hot days, and that such extreme events may have disproportionate impacts on intertidal populations.","University of Washington, Friday Harbor Labs",Montclair State University,University of Washington,"University of Washington, Biology Dept.",,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Dethier, M.N.",,,,,NA,NA,"Kobelt, J.","Yiu, D.","Ruesink, J.L.",,,,,,4,Yes,Intertidal Ecology,Population Biology and Ecology,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,12,,Intertidal Ecology,

Recent work reveals that strong and nearly persistent upwelling activity in the Galapagos supports high algal cover and growth, weakening grazer effects. Further, El Niño events can generate interannual variation in upwelling intensity, community structure and grazing effects. Upwelling activity can also be intermittent or seasonal, however, and such variation could lead to seasonal variability in ecological processes on tropical rocky shores. We deployed herbivore exclusion experiments replicated across three regions along the Pacific coast of Panama, and repeated during upwelling and non-upwelling seasons, to examine how seasonal and regional variation in upwelling activity influences herbivore effects on initial succession. Sites exposed to seasonal upwelling activity in the Gulf of Panama and the Azuero peninsula exhibited increases in algal cover, particularly foliose algae, during the upwelling season. The increase in algal cover was accompanied by weak herbivore effects resulting from increased algal cover in treatments exposed to grazers. This seasonal pattern was absent in the Gulf of Chiriqui, where upwelling is largely absent or restricted to deeper areas. Sites in that region were characterized by low algal cover and strong grazer effects throughout the year. Thus, our results demonstrate that seasonality in oceanographic regimes can generate seasonal shifts in community structure and top-down control on tropical rocky shores.",McGill University/Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,McGill University,University of Florida,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Sellers, A.J.",,,,,NA,NA,"Torchin, M.E.","Leung, B.","Altieri, A.H.",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Intertidal Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,12,,Intertidal Ecology,

The cost–benefit ratio of parental care often fluctuates with environmental conditions, and thus the selection of favourable nesting habitats may allow care-giving parents to optimize their fitness. Male plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) provide sole care to offspring in nests distributed along a tidal elevation gradient. Results from complementary lab and field experiments indicate that temperature and oxygen conditions become more severe at higher intertidal elevations. Males readily compete for nests across all elevations in the field, but male mass decreased with increasing elevation, suggesting a prevalence of less competitive males in harsher environmental conditions. However, plainfin midshipman eggs developed faster under warmer temperatures, and moreover, nests at an intermediate elevation received the most spawnings. Together, these results indicate that the cost–benefit ratio of parental care in plainfin midshipman is set by abiotic conditions experienced across an environmental gradient. Thus, certain zones within nesting habitats are likely more sensitive to disturbance; rising sea levels pose concern, as sandy beaches are beginning to erode.","McMaster University

"Stephens, Tiffany",tastephens@alaska.edu,2018-10-03 18:27,Sea otter disturbance reduces eelgrass extent of intertidal beds in southeast Alaska,"Seagrass ecosystems experience multiple stressors that complicate management and pose risks to resource protection. Recently, sea otters were described to ameliorate eutrophication stressors via trophic cascade interactions. When foraging for some prey, however, sea otters dig into marine sediments, sometimes removing seagrass biomass. Previous surveys suggest increased digging along the upper edge of eelgrass beds, where preferred prey dominate. We investigated whether bioturbation by sea otters reduces the extent to which eelgrass can grow using observational and experimental approaches. Observationally, we quantified the mean tidal elevation of the upper extent of eelgrass across a sea otter gradient, for which beds at sites with low activity were expected to extend higher in the intertidal. Experimentally, we installed caged plots at ten sites to exclude sea otter digging at the bed’s edge, as well as uncaged control plots. At sites with lower sea otter activity, the upper edges grew higher in the intertidal compared to sites with high activity. This translates into a reduction of about 3.5 m^2 eelgrass per m^2 shoreline. Experimental plots suggest sea otters removed about 15-fold more surface habitat than measured in protected plots. This research identifies that sea otters may play an important role in the maintenance of seagrass through disruption of the bed margins. Such bioturbation could have significant implications to the ecosystem services that eelgrass provides -- high primary productivity, habitat for juvenile and forage fishes, and carbon sequestration.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,"University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of Alaska Southeast",University of Alaska Fairbanks,"University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of Tasmania",University of Alaska Fairbanks,,,,,NA,NA,University of Alaska Fairbanks,,,,"Stephens, T.A",,,,,NA,NA,"Shields, M.","Raymond, W.W.","Borup, M.","Domke, L.","Eckert, G.",,,,6,Yes,Intertidal Ecology,Community Ecology,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,12,,Intertidal Ecology,

We tagged and measured 100 individuals of each species at two locations near its range limit and two range-central locations >450 km from the range limit. Each month, we measured length and circumference of all individuals, estimated reproductive output, and counted the number of recruits surrounding each individual. At sites near the equatorward limit of *P. californica*, individuals were smaller in size and had higher mortality than populations at sites in the central part of its range. *S. compressa* individuals were similar in biomass at the two range-central sites and at the site closest to its poleward range limit, and mortality was similar across all sites. Regardless of species or site, reproductive output was low, and survivorship of zygotes was also low. Our data suggest that populations of *P. californica* near its equatorward range limit are in decline compared to more central locations, whereas populations of *S. compressa* near its poleward limit perform similarly to range-central populations. Since rockweeds play an important role in maintaining diversity the decline in rockweed populations near their equatorward limit may have important ramifications for biodiversity of associated species on California rocky shores.","University of California, Irvine","University of California, Irvine",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Elsberry, L.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Bracken, M.E.S.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Intertidal Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,13,,Intertidal Ecology,

However, few studies have explored how local adaptation contributes to variability in biological responses to multiple stressors. Here we test the hypothesis that local adaptation in a predatory whelk, *Nucella lamellosa*, impacts responses (growth, feeding and mortality rates) to ocean warming and acidification. Over eight weeks, we exposed four populations from two regions in British Columbia (Calvert Island in the north and Nanaimo in the south) to temperature and pH treatments based on in situ oceanographic measurements and on predicted changes over the next 100 years. We found that temperature and source population both significantly impacted growth rates, but that lowered acidity had no effect on growth. Interestingly, snails from the northern populations grew more than the southern populations across all treatments; however, they also had 65% higher mortality in the hot treatments than the southern snails. Finally, snail feeding rates were higher in hot acidified treatments compared with ambient treatments, despite there being no significant growth differences. Our results suggest that local adaptation plays an important role in determining population responses to stressors and that the interactive effect of multiple stressors changes over thermal ranges and impacts energetic allocations. Addressing this variability will improve the ability for community ecologists, managers and researchers to understand how climate change impacts local ecosystems.","Zoology, University of British Columbia","Zoology, University of British Columbia",University of British Columbia,"Zoology, University of British Columbia",,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Beaty, F.L.",,,,,NA,NA,"Harley, C.D.G","Brownlee, G.","Gehman, A",,,,,,4,No,Intertidal Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,13,,Intertidal Ecology,

The perceived patchiness of prey, however, depends on a predator’s rate of movement. To optimize net energy gain, predators should therefore move through the environment at speeds that reduce perceived prey patchiness, minimizing energy expenditure while maximizing the homogeneity of prey encounter rates. Here, we quantify the scale-dependent patchiness of an intertidal invertebrate community and compare it to the movement patterns of intertidal predatory whelks, *Nucella ostrina*. To assess predator movement, individually marked whelks were relocated daily over a 3-month period. Variation in community patchiness was quantified by estimating ?-diversity at five spatial scales (0.025 to 400 m^2^) over a four-year successional sequence of experimentally-cleared patches. Our analyses indicate that whelk individuals exhibited patterns of daily displacement that, on average, matched the spatial scale at which the patchiness of their preferred prey increased (~1.5 m^2^).  This spatial scale differed from the scale at which the patchiness of the intertidal community at large increased. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that whelks forage at speeds that maximize the homogeneity of prey encounter rates while minimizing energy expenditure.

We looked at population demographics and vertical distributions along the intertidal gradient of four predator species (*Nucella canaliculata, Nucella ostrina, Pisaster ochraceus*, and *Leptasterias spp.*) at over 25 sites from Oregon to Central California. Predator densities of all species are higher in Oregon than in California. This is associated with high densities of juveniles for 3 of these predators (*Nucella ostrina, Pisaster ochraceus,* and *Leptasterias spp.*). These results suggest that Oregon populations have higher rates of reproduction and survival, so may be less sensitive to rapid change than those in California. Vertical distributions of all predators were shifted lower relative to sea level in California versus Oregon, which may be associated with decreasing wave action and tidal amplitude and increasing physical stress at more southern latitudes. There is high overlap in zonation between sea star competitors, but some separation among zones between snail competitors, and these trends were consistent with latitude. We also investigate how predator sizes vary with shore level and latitude. This detailed inventory of size-specific zonation and latitudinal distribution enables us to establish a baseline distribution of these predators, investigate the environmental factors controlling species’ densities and ranges, and may allow us to infer what may happen as the climate warms and sea levels rise.",Oregon State University,Oregon State University,Oregon State University,"University of California, Santa Cruz",Oregon State University,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Chiachi, A.E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Gravem, S.A.","Bachhuber, S.M.","Raimondi, P.T.","Menge, B.A.",,,,,5,No,Intertidal Ecology,Community Ecology,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,13,,Intertidal Ecology,

Mussel bed limits along the California and Oregon coastlines were used as a metric of ecosystem sensitivity to loss of keystone predation as mussels are a dominant intertidal species.

Analysis of relative mussel bed movement since 2013 indicates variable bed movement with static beds at most sites. Lack of significant downward bed movement is inconsistent with predictions of mussel takeover and an indication of possible ecosystem resilience coast-wide. In addition, latitudinal trends in relative mussel bed position, bed depths, and mussel sizes were investigated.

The six-rayed sea star, *Leptasterias* spp. (Class Asteroidea), is a common brooder in the Pacific rocky intertidal. While previous research has shown that *Leptasterias* spp. is an important ecological predator, little is known about its mating and reproductive success in natural populations. In this study, through the use of Next-Generation sequencing, we developed multiple microsatellite markers for a species of *Leptasterias* collected from the central coast of Oregon, U.S.A, for use in genetic parentage analysis. A total of 439 embryos from 15 broods were genotyped and analyzed along with their mothers. Analyses revealed high rates of polyandry in all but one of the clutches analyzed, with as many as 38 fathers detected in a single brood, which is among the highest reported in marine invertebrates. Furthermore, two broods collected from the field were found to contain several offspring that did not belong to the mother carrying the clutch. Given the rarity of alloparental care by females in nature, as well as the high environmental stress brooding sea stars face on the intertidal, this behavior could provide insights into the costs and benefits of parental care within this dynamic ecosystem.","Department of Integrative Biology, Oregon State University","Department of Integrative Biology, Oregon State University",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Bauer, K.K",,,,,NA,NA,"Barreto, F.S.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Behavioral Ecology,"Reproduction, Dispersal, and Recruitment","No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,14,,MPA,MPA

After a massive mortality event affected commercially important resources off the coast of Isla Natividad (IN) in Baja California Sur, Mexico, local fisher’s cooperatives and other institutions joined together to establish marine reserves. The design, implementation and monitoring of these reserves are an unprecedented example of co-management in highly variable ecosystems. The goal of this study is to analyze whether this successful management example could be replicated at Islas Todos Santos (ITS). We compared the two sites within five different categories: 1) geomorphology, 2) ecology, 3) socioeconomics, 4) fisheries and aquaculture, and 5) management and conservation. We found both islands are comparable with similar ecological characteristics but show important differences in socio-economics and management. For example, we found both islands have similar species composition but IN has co-managed territorial fisheries rights while ITS only has concessions for resources with overlapping groups of fishers.

MPAs are predicted to replenish exploited populations via the export of young, but the models that make these predictions rely on assumptions that have recently been demonstrated to be false for most species of fish. A recent meta-analysis showed that fish reproductive output scales hyperallometrically with fish mass, such that larger fish produce more offspring per unit body mass than smaller fish.

Successful sexual reproduction and recruitment are essential for recovery and maintenance of genetic variation in coral populations. Reproductive plasticity and parental effects in response to elevated sea surface temperatures, however, remain understudied in corals.  Recent bleaching events in Hawaii elicited high variation in bleaching susceptibility in *Montipora capitata*, a dominant reef-building coral and hermaphroditic broadcast spawner.  *M. capitata* colonies in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu were selected based on their bleaching response in 2015 (bleached and recovered vs. nonbleached) to examine parental effects associated with bleaching history and manipulative thermal conditioning.  Colonies were split and conditioned for five months under control and high temperature treatments representative of historical conditions in K?ne?ohe Bay (average vs. average +2°C, n = 10 treatment-1).  Conditioning encompassed spermatogenesis, vertical transmission of zooxanthellae, egg-sperm bundle formation, and spawning events to generate reaction norms for spawning dynamics and gamete traits.

However, in a literature review, we find little empirical support for this notion of  ""managed resilience"". We outline some reasons for why MPAs and herbivorous fish (especially parrotfish) protection have had little effect on coral resilience. One key explanation is that impacts of local stressors (e.g., pollution and fishing) are often swamped by the much greater effect of ocean warming on corals. Another is the sheer complexity (including numerous context dependencies) of the five cascading links assumed by the managed resilience hypothesis. If reefs cannot be saved by local actions, it is time to face reef degradation head-on, by directly addressing anthropogenic climate change: the root cause of global coral decline.","Department of Biology, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA 27599-3280","Earth to Ocean Research Group, Department of Biological Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","United States Geological Survey, St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center, 600 4th Street South, St. Petersburg, FL, 33701, U.S.A.",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,John F.

A wide range of symbiont densities within anemones are common in the field, most likely because *Anthopleura* anemones can rely entirely on captured prey for their dietary requirements if necessary. Some of this variation can be attributed to tide height and light availability, but symbionts may also vary with sea anemone species, prey availability, and color phenotype (e.g., fluorescent proteins). Because zooxanthellae contribute dietary carbon to their host anemone, they may be particularly important when prey availability is low. An observational study investigating photosynthetic efficiency (F~v~/F~m~), symbiont density, and chlorophyll concentrations within the species *A. sola* was combined with an experiment investigating the effect of prey availability on algal symbionts within *A. sola* and *A. xanthogrammica*. In *A. sola*, chlorophyll concentrations and symbiont densities were higher in tentacles of dark color morphs, but different tissue types showed different results. Between *A. sola* and *A. xanthogrammica*, symbionts within *A. xanthogrammica* increased their photochemical efficiency (F~v~/F~m~) when prey availability increased, whereas symbionts within *A. sola* did not change their photochemical efficiency in any treatment. *A. xanthogrammica* may be able to take advantage of an increase in prey availability and pass on those benefits to its symbionts, whereas *A. sola* may not.",University of California Irvine,University of California Irvine,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Bedgood, S.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Bracken, M.E.S.",,,,,,,,2,Yes,Intertidal Ecology,Physiological Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,15,,Physiological Ecology,Intertidal Ecology

Marine intertidal organisms, such as mussels, face unique environmental challenges such as aerial exposure and oxygen limitation that can catalyze their physiological response in dealing with different stressors. Specifically, *Mytilus galloprovincialis*, an invasive Mediterranean mussel that has experienced a shift in their historical range due to a warming climate, is able to physiologically tolerate warmer (and maybe cooler) temperatures, outcompeting its native congener. We are interested in investigating what physiological processes allow these warm adapted mussels to tolerate vastly different habitats. To do so, heart rate, a proxy for understanding whole-organismal response, was measured with increasing temperature. We collected *M. galloprovincialis* from subtidal and intertidal sites and recorded heart rate during several ramping experiments at 4 °C hr^-1 with a temperature range of 8-28 °C for two different treatments (aerial or submerged). Preliminary data for the subtidal population suggests an inverse relationship; as aerial temperature increases, mussel heart rate decreases until 24°C. In contrary, for our submerged treatment, mussel heart rate was relatively constant regardless of temperature.

The California mussel *Mytilus californianus* (the dominant competitor for space on many shores) is a model for exploring how sessile animals cope physiologically with extreme thermal stresses. Thus, mussels provide important predictive information about how climate change will affect many intertidal animals. Cardiac thermal tolerance, measured as Arrhenius break temperature (ABT, temperature when heart rate declines) or flat-line temperature (FLT, temperature when the heart stops), quantifies a mussel’s survivability. However, it is unknown whether heating rate (which varies widely in the field) independently affects ABT or FLT, and if mussels acclimatized to different intertidal heights respond similarly. *M. californianus* from low and high zones (0.56 vertical m apart) underwent thermal tolerance tests in air at heating rates from 2.4 to 8.6 &deg;C/h (spanning field measured rates), while their heart rates were measured via infrared sensor. High- and low-zone mussels had similar ABT up to heating rates of ~5 &deg;C/h; thereafter high-zone mussels’ ABT increased with heating rate while low-zone mussels’ ABT remained unchanged. FLT was unaffected by zone or heating rate. Overall, heating rate affects cardiac thermal tolerance in high- but not low-zone mussels.

Dense packing of mussels in these beds creates shading among neighbors, which can maintain cooler conditions within the interstices of the bed’s matrix during hot low tides. Mussels in the top layer of a bed may be only partly exposed to sun due to shading by neighbors, leaving only the posterior end of the shell in direct sunlight. This should lead to differential warming rates along the anterior-posterior axis, potentially keeping anterior portions of the tissues cooler than the sun-exposed posterior. We present laboratory and field measurements of gradients within individual mussels where only a portion of the posterior end of the shell is exposed to direct heating. Using thermocouple sensor transects and infrared imaging, we find that anterior tissue temperatures can be 3-5 °C cooler than posterior tissue temperatures. These gradients were comparable in live mussels, previously-frozen mussels with internal tissues intact, and water-filled shells, indicating that the effect of internal mixing by the live mussel may be minimal during emersion, when other physiological processes are typically reduced to save energy. The temperature gradient has the potential to limit thermal stress in some portions of the mussel even as solar heating brings the sun-exposed portion of the mussel shell up to stressful temperatures. This possibility brings into question previous physiological work that has not taken this gradient into account.","San Diego State University,

Shells’ ability to defend from such forces is traditionally quantified with a simple strength test: a shell is rapidly compressed until it breaks. However, this technique cannot test the alternative possibility that low magnitude, repeated stresses can break a shell through the process of fatigue. We explored the threat of different realistic sources of shell damage by quantifying and contextualizing the strength and fatigue resistance of the California mussel (*Mytilus californianus*). We repeated the classic strength test, compressing shells until fracture, and we used two distinct tests of fatigue resistance: a subcritical load was either applied constantly (i.e., static loading) or cyclically until fracture. Both fatigue tests considered a range of subcritical forces to mimic threats to mussels in the field. When stripped of living tissue, shells fatigued and broke under static and cyclic loading; lower forces required more cycles or longer static loading periods to cause fracture. This relationship demonstrates how seemingly insignificant forces could ultimately generate lethal damage, and invites the question of whether living tissue can counteract fatigue. These findings highlight how a range of accumulated threats might underlie variation in shell morphology, and provide inspiration for future studies on the evolution of shell form.",Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University,Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Crane, R.L.",,,,,NA,NA,"Denny, M.W.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Physiological Ecology,Intertidal Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,15,,Physiological Ecology,

Parental exposure to ocean acidification has been shown to induce larval carryover effects, but whether or not an acute exposure to a stressor as an adult can influence the larval generation long after the stress has been removed has yet to be tested. To assess how a temporary exposure to experimental ocean acidification affects the ecologically and commercially relevant Pacific oyster (*Crassostrea gigas*), adult oysters were exposed to either low pH (7.31 ± 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 ± 0.02) conditions for seven weeks. Oysters were then held for eight weeks in ambient conditions, and subsequently conditioned for four weeks at ambient pH. After reproductive conditioning, oysters were strip-spawned to create four families based on maternal and paternal ocean acidification exposure. The number of D-hinge larvae were counted eighteen hours post fertilization. A sex-specific broodstock response was observed, where female exposure to low pH conditions resulted in fewer D-hinge larvae. This study demonstrates that the effects of ocean acidification can last beyond the time from when the environmental perturbation is experienced. Broadening the understanding of environmental memory will be valuable when considering an organism’s ability to persist in the face of environmental change change.","School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA","School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA","School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Venkataraman, Y.R.",,,,,NA,NA,"Spencer, L.H.","Roberts, S.B.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Physiological Ecology,Applied Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,15,,Physiological Ecology,

One such disease is *Montipora* White Syndrome (MWS) which affects the Pacific reef building coral, *Montipora capitata*. There are two forms of MWS: acute (aMWS, fast moving-occurring in winter months) and chronic (cMWS, slow moving-year round incidences). Recent studies have explored the bacterial community composition of corals infected with aMWS but no studies have explored the immune response or bacterial community structure of cMWS. This study explores the bacterial community composition using 16S rRNA sequencing, and immune response by testing for prophenoloxidase (PPO) activity in 3 coral tissue types: diseased tissue (MD), healthy tissue of diseased colonies (MDH), and healthy colonies (MH). The bacterial community composition of MD samples was significantly different from MDH (Tukey, p=0.034) and MH samples (Tukey, p=0.034). For example, the class oscillatoriophycideae appeared predominantly in MD tissue wile bacilli occurred only in MH samples. PPO assays indicated that immune competence was decreased only in MD samples (Tukey, MD vs MH p=0.010, MD vs MDH p=0.050). We found that cMWS alters the bacterial community and immune competence of only the tissue affected by the disease and not healthy tissue on the same colony.

In addition, climate change is predicted to alter wind patterns, expanding the upwelling season and the frequency of exposure to these conditions. Gopher rockfish (*Sebastes carnatus*), a viviparous species, inhabit nearshore waters along the CCS. To determine how exposure to these stressors during gestation affects larval performance, we studied gene expression in *S. carnatus* larvae at two time points; 1) at birth after a month of gestation in one of three treatments: control (pH 8.0, DO 8.0 mg/L), low pH (7.5), low DO (4.0 mg/L), and 2) after a subsequent 5-day exposure to each treatment. We utilized RNAseq to assemble a *de novo* transcriptome and analyze differential gene expression (DGE) for each timepoint. We found that DGE profiles were strongly driven by the maternal treatment condition rather than the subsequent larval exposure. Larvae undergoing embryogenesis in low pH showed a stronger DGE response than those in a low DO maternal environment relative to ambient conditions (486 vs. 78 DGE, edgeR: FDR < 0.01). Both stressor treatments decreased expression of genes involved in developmental processes, including eye (low pH group) and spinal (low DO group) development, deformities that were also observed  at parturition. Our results suggest that gestational exposure to low pH and low DO induces significant changes in the expression of genes that may be critical for normal larval development.","Moss Landing Marine Laboratories

The balance between energetic gains (consumption) and energetic costs (metabolism) mediate the flow of energy through trophic levels and is crucial to maintaining ecosystem function. Therefore, a mismatch between the scaling of consumption and metabolism due to global change stressors could impact ecosystem stability. Here, we present results on the impacts of pH and temperature on the metabolic and grazing rates of five common kelp forest invertebrate grazers, Chlorostoma brunnea, Pomaulax gibberosa, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, and Idotea resecata.

Potential effects of OA on fleshy macroalgae that are critical constituents of many marine habitats are less well known, however it is predicted that increased carbon dioxide (CO~2~) and temperature due to climate change might have positive effects on the growth and photosynthesis of fleshy macroalgae. This study examined the growth and photosynthetic rates of two common tropical fleshy macroalgae (*Turbinaria ornata* and *Sargassum pacificum*) under ambient and elevated pCO~2~ and temperature in a factorial design. The contribution of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) to the uptake of inorganic carbon for use in the photosynthetic process also was measured by using inhibitors of both external and internal CA. Results indicate no significant difference of either elevated pCO~2~ or temperature on either photosynthetic or growth rates. However, CA inhibitors significantly reduced photosynthetic rates.

Animals moving at the speed of environmental shifts can optimize body temperature, whereas animals that are slow relative to environmental fluctuations may be able to use predictable patterns, such as the two-week tidal cycle, to thermoregulate. In the intertidal zone, temperature fluctuations are rapid (minutes to hours), yet tides limit the potential for thermal extremes to specific days of a two-week cycle. The intertidal snail *Nucella ostrina* is not only slow in movement, but slow in feeding. *N. ostrina* makes its prolonged foraging bouts to risky high shore areas only on the days of the tidal cycle that are predictably devoid of thermal extremes. We combined snail foraging behavior, body temperature from physical thermal models, and thermal performance assays, to model the environment snails experience during low tide exposure. We found snail performance relatively high in cool and moderate treatments, but performance dropped quickly above 30°C with > 50% mortality at 35°C. Our model showed a 60% or greater reduction in thermal risk for a migrating versus stationary snail. This reduction persisted when we considered increasing temperatures predicted by climate change. This behavioral filter of environment greatly reduces the proportion of time *N. ostrina* is exposed to risky temperatures.

Corals form the foundation of reef ecosystems and are subject corallivory (coral predation), which depletes energy reserves leaving corals ill-equipped to survive simultaneous perturbations. The muricid gastropod, *Coralliophila violacea*, feeds on corals for extended periods of time, creating energy sinks that may increase corals’ susceptibility to terrestrial runoff (i.e., sediment accumulation and nutrient pollution). These co-occurring anthropogenic stressors have negative effects on coral survival and may act synergistically with corallivory to worsen coral condition. We tested the effects of sedimentation, nutrient enrichment, and snail corallivory on massive *Porites* survival and physiology using a factorial field experiment in Moorea, French Polynesia. *Coralliophila violacea* predation did not act synergistically with sedimentation or nutrient enrichment to exacerbate coral mortality and final percent algal cover or alter *Symbiodinium* densities. Corallivory independently increased coral mortality and algal cover and reduced *Symbiodinium* densities. Meanwhile, nutrient enrichment increased *Symbiodinium* densities with sediment addition suppressing this effect.

An increase in atmospheric CO~2~ causes ocean acidification (OA), and reduces calcification in many reef builders, such as crustose coralline algae (CCA). Macroalgal photosynthesis may mitigate OA locally through carbon uptake, resulting in a local increase in pH. The effect of seawater buffering on calcifiers was quantified in a mesocosm study and subsequent field study conducted in Moorea, French Polynesia. The common canopy-forming alga *Sargassum pacificum* and co-occurring CCA *Lithophyllum kotschyanum* were used to test whether fleshy algae can buffer seawater from OA, and consequently alter CCA physiology. In the mesocosm study, a *Sargassum* header tank was used to provide treatment seawater to CCA samples. In the field, *Sargassum* canopies were attached to 8x12 grids, upstream from CCA samples. Data from the mesocosm study support this buffering effect, but the effect did not translate into the field. This disconnect may be due to physical effects of the canopy, such as shading, since *Sargassum* was placed in closer proximity to CCA samples in the field than in lab. This study suggests that upstream macroalgal communities have the potential to mitigate the negative effects of OA to downstream calcifiers, but will not benefit understory calcifiers.","California State University, Northridge","California State University, Northridge",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Perng, L.Y.",,,,,NA,NA,"Carpenter, R.C.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Physiological Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,17,,Physiological Ecology,

Juvenile Copper (*Sebastes caurinus*) and Gopher (*S. carnatus*) Rockfish may be particularly vulnerable to low pH and hypoxia as they settle nearshore during upwelling season. To determine how future projected upwelling conditions will impact rockfish fitness, we exposed juveniles to one of the following treatments: periodic upwelling (a recurring cycle of 8 days of 7.3 pH, 2.0 mg/L DO, followed by 8 days of recovery at ambient conditions), extreme static reduced pH/DO (7.3 pH, 2.0 mg/L DO), moderate static reduced pH/DO (7.5 pH, 4.0 mg/L DO), or a static ambient treatment (~8.1 pH, ~8.6 mg/L DO). Responses to sublethal stress were evaluated through behavioral and physiological trials including escape challenge, brain lateralization, critical swimming speed, and aerobic scope. Both species exhibited significant impairment in aerobic scope and swimming ability under simulated upwelling conditions, performing equally to fish in the extreme treatment. In the fluctuating treatment both species appeared to recover fully when returned to ambient seawater for 6-7 days, but Copper Rockfish showed reductions in growth rate, suggesting lasting impacts of exposure. Evaluation of the other response variables is underway.

Often, they do so by creating three-dimensional structure via the dense aggregation of individuals. The reduced exchange of air or water into the interstices of these biogenic habitats is known to ameliorate a variety of potential stressors, including high temperatures, desiccation, and dangerously rapid flows. However, living in a dense assemblage can also bring costs for example by intensifying intraspecific competition or by slowing rates at which waste products are removed. Here we explore the potential for such costs to constrain core physiological processes underlying growth of the common west coast ecosystem engineer, the California mussel, Mytilus californianus. Within dense beds formed by the California mussel, respiration and calcification can alter local seawater chemistry through the accumulation of CO~2~ and the depletion of oxygen and bicarbonate. At the same time, the concentrations of these substances can feed back to influence respiration and calcification themselves. To test the extent to which such feedbacks operate in this system, we conducted incubation experiments that decoupled the availability of oxygen from that of key substrates for calcification, allowing us to explicitly investigate whether seawater altered by habitat forming mussels can lead to a scenario of self-limitation in this species. These experiments help to reveal the factors governing the formation and maintenance of both modern mussel beds and beds in a changing ocean.",Bodega Marine Lab,"Bodega Marine Lab, Department of Evolution and Ecology, UC Davis",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Ninokawa, A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Gaylord, B.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Physiological Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,17,,Physiological Ecology,

Although respirometry can be used to measure metabolic rates of small marine animals under laboratory conditions, how these results translate to the natural environment remains poorly understood. This is particularly so for pelagic squid, which arguably constitute the largest predatory biomass on the planet and are generally characterized by exceptionally high metabolic rates based on lab studies. Here we designed and tested the feasibility of a small waterproof animal-borne accelerometer tag for deployment on California market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens). Our data logger was used in conjunction with swim tunnel respirometry to record the rate of mass-specific oxygen consumption and overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) of tagged squid at different swimming speeds and orientations. We found a positive correlation between ODBA and swimming speed, as well as ODBA and metabolic rate. Across swimming speeds, the energetic cost of arms-first locomotion, which is associated with foraging and reproductive behaviors, is higher compared to the tail-first swimming associated with long-distance travel.

Heavy thalli can weigh up to 20 kg in air, creating a substantial negative force that acts against the buoyant pneumatocyst, potentially causing thalli to sink. We measured net buoyancy, thallus weight, and pneumatocyst buoyant force to investigate how buoyancy increases to support the weight of growing sporophytes. We then estimated the buoyant safety factor of various sizes of pneumatocysts to investigate how buoyancy is regulated throughout sporophyte development.  Contrary to expectations, total buoyant force is steadily outpaced by the weight of growing sporophytes, so the risk of the sinking increases with age. Adult sporophytes are estimated to sink when pneumatocyst volume reaches 1.3 L, which is close to maximum observed sizes in the field, suggesting that buoyancy may ultimately limit how large *Nereocystis* sporophytes can grow.",University of British Columbia,University of British Columbia,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Liggan, L.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Martone, P.T.",,,,,,,,2,No,Population Biology and Ecology,Physiological Ecology,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,18,,Physiological Ecology,Population Biology and Ecology

These changes are exacerbated by increases in upwelling intensity.  Gopher rockfish (*Sebastes carnatus*) and Blue rockfish (*Sebastes mystinus*) are ecologically and economically valuable rockfish species with differing life history characteristics that affect their exposure to low pH and low DO water. To test how ocean acidification and hypoxia may interact to influence the reproductive process in rockfish, we exposed gravid females of both species to 4 treatments throughout the gestation period: 1) low pH (pH 7.5); 2) low DO (DO 4.0 mg/L); 3) a combined stressor (pH 7.5 x DO 4.0 mg/L); and 4) control (pH 8.0 x DO 8.0). At parturition, the proportion and type of larval deformities were quantified. Post-parturition, larvae from each brood were seeded into each of the 4 treatments to evaluate survivorship as a function of the prior maternal treatment conditions and the subsequent larval treatment. Preliminary results indicate that larval survivorship in *S. carnatus* is significantly influenced by the low pH maternal gestation treatment, while there was no effect of the subsequent larval exposure on survival. *S. carnatus* larvae from low DO and combined stressor maternal treatments exhibited increased deformities.

In current-feeding cnidarian hydromedusae, swimming and predation are coupled such that swimming also brings prey into contact with feeding structures. The resultant fluid mechanical disturbance can initiate escape responses in some prey types. The goals of this study were 1) to determine if the passive (tentacle extension and no active motion) and active feeding behavior (contraction and expansion of the subumbrellar cavity) of C. gregaria affects the predation process of co-occurring prey types and 2) if the differences in the magnitude of the fluid signals produced by each of the medusa’s swimming behaviors correlates with the type of prey captured. Two dimensional videos were used to quantify the encounter, capture, transfer and ingestion efficiency of different prey types. Passive and slow swimming prey such as invertebrate larvae were encountered and captured during both types of feeding behavior, whereas prey with active escape responses such as copepods were only captured during passive feeding. Flow visualizations using particle image velocimetry showed that the fluid deformation values produced by the medusae during passive feeding were below threshold shear values that trigger escape responses of copepods. This study furthers our understanding of the trophic niches of tentaculate predators and, more broadly, how fluid flow mediates predator-prey interactions in the ocean.","Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, University of Oregon","Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, University of Oregon",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Corrales-Ugalde, M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Sutherland, K.R.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,18,,Physiological Ecology,

BFC contains rock walls, boulders and rock rubble which provide the types of crevices morays tend to occupy. We trapped morays over a three year period in BFC to investigate the demographics, diet, and overall body condition and compared them to our recent findings outside of the CMLR. Morays in the reserve and those outside of the reserve showed a similar distribution in body size. However, in the reserve we found fewer morays with stomach contents compared to outside of the reserve. Lastly, body condition varied between morays in the two populations.

Thereby predator-prey interactions, which are fundamental to understanding marine communities are strongly influenced by changes in environmental temperature. While interpecific comparisons of fish metabolic rates are common, those that measure how metabolic rate changes over ontogeny within species are rare. Using closed-system respirometry, we analyzed the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of the California moray *(Gymnothorax mordax)* over ontogeny and at two common temperatures. Our results show that going from a warm treatment (22C) to a cold treatment (16C), the SMR for *G. mordax* lowered, on average, by 26.71 mg O2kg^-1^hr^-1^. As anticipated, mass-specific metabolic rates were higher for smaller individuals, typical of most organisms. However, when exposed to colder temperatures, mass-specific SMRs for smaller individuals were suppressed compared to larger individuals. The SMRs for larger individuals in the cold water treatment deviated little from the warm water treatment, suggesting that larger morays are not as affected by changes in temperature. In general, *G. mordax* appears to have lower SMRs compared to other teleosts of similar body size, but not shape. When compared to closely related Anguilliformes, we observed similar SMRs & O2 consumption rates. We observed that larger individuals had a subcutaneous adipose layer along the length of their body that may assist in heat retention and explain the smaller SMR response to lower environmental temperatures.","University of California, Santa Cruz","University of California, Santa Cruz",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Higgins, B.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Mehta, R.S.",,,,,,,,2,No,,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,18,,Physiological Ecology,

This project is the first to explore the interactive effects of high pCO2 and temperature on the acclimation and acclimatization potential of the purple-hinge rock scallop (Crassadoma gigantea). Scallops were exposed to variable pCO2 and temperature treatments to test acclimation potential in the lab. Subsequently, scallops were placed in the field at variable depths to assess acclimatization potential in their natural habitat. Thermal stress was the primary driver for increased short-term oxygen consumption rates, growth, and changes in the microbiome. A combination of factors including temperature, pCO2, and other oceanographic variations (in field experiments), additively or synergistically affected scallop’s shell morphology, total lipids, and fatty acid content. Results demonstrate that thermal stress is the primary source for fluctuations in phenotypic plasticity, however combinations of stressors further disrupt homeostasis and may have long term consequences for C. gigantea fitness, the ecosystem they support, and their emerging presence in the aquaculture industry. Furthermore, this project highlights the importance of using dynamic marine environments as a natural lab to predict future acclimatization potential of a species as global change continues.","School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington; Department of Biology, California State University Dominguez Hills","Department of Biology, California State University Dominguez Hills","School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington","Department of Biology, California State University Dominguez Hills","School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington; Department of Biology, California State University Dominguez Hills",,,,,,,"Department of Biology, California State University Dominguez Hills; Taylor Shellfish Hatchery","School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington; Department of Biology, California State University Dominguez Hills",,,"Alma, L.",,,,,,,"Kram, K.

Anemones were distributed along vertical walls in shallow communities (less than 18 meters), but become more abundant on sloping and horizontal surfaces deeper. *M. farcimen* populations are highly impacted by depth and surface orientation, which relates heavily with light, but density, at the site level, is unrelated to neither current nor temperature.

By employing non-invasive, fecal floatation methods to yield parasite eggs from the scats of Pacific harbor seals (*Phoca vitulina richardii*), this study sought to provide an assessment of the abundance and diversity of gastrointestinal helminth parasites of harbor seals in south Puget Sound, WA. Harbor seal scats were collected from a known haul-out site over seven sampling bouts from August 2017 – January 2018, spanning from pupping season through post-weaning. A temporal increase in helminth burden as pups were weaned was hypothesized, coinciding with the loss of maternal immunity and acquisition of parasitic infection through trophic transmission. Eggs of five species of helminths were identified, including the tapeworm: *Diphyllobothrium* sp.; and, roundworms: *Contracaecum* sp., *Anasakis simplex*, *Ascaris* sp., and *Parafilaroides* sp.; which increased in diversity post-weaning, in late September and November. An increase in prevalence of helminths was also observed in November. The mean density of helminth eggs recovered was heavily influenced by the presence of *Diphyllobothrium* sp., and was highest in late September and November.

While many studies have sought to document and understand the drivers of synchrony, rarely have studies attempted to distinguish among the potential drivers of asynchrony, particularly in cases where synchrony is predicted but not observed. In many marine species, populations are coupled by dispersal and subject to correlated environmental drivers, yet are not strongly synchronous. We present a hierarchical time-delay embedding framework based on Gaussian process regression that can empirically quantify nonlinear population dynamics, and which provides a novel and interpretable way to distinguish among alternative explanations for asynchrony. This approach produces a “dynamic correlation” metric quantifying similarity in the response of populations to predictor variables, irrespective of their correlation (synchrony) in time. We examined the dynamics of blue crabs (*Callinectes sapidus*) from 17 populations across the U.S. Atlantic coast using fishery-independent time series data. Although estimates of synchrony among populations were negligible, dynamic correlations among populations were strong, broadly similar, and exhibited spatial patterning. Moreover, the time series for all populations had positive Lyapunov exponents, suggesting chaotic dynamics. These results suggest that noise and nonlinearity may destabilize synchrony and obscure hidden dynamical similarities among nearby populations that appear superficially independent.",Northeastern University/NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center,NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Rogers, T.L.",,,,,NA,NA,"Munch, S.B.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Population Biology and Ecology,Fisheries Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,19,,Population Biology and Ecology,

Occurring at multiple sites around Ulithi Atoll, its presence is strongly correlated with human activities, peaking in abundance at boat landings and heavily fished areas. This coral appears to be causing declines in reef function due to its ability to quickly overgrow other corals, limiting coral diversity, reducing structural complexity, and depressing fish diversity and abundance. Its presence and abundance on reefs were major drivers in site clustering based on benthic structure, and dendrograms of fish diversity showed remarkably similar patterns, indicative of ecological relationships between corals and fish communities.

In many species, the success of larvae in feeding and growing while dispersing and avoiding predation in the plankton determines potential for population recovery. Typically, larvae from larger eggs develop faster than larvae from smaller eggs, subjecting them to less predation during development. The evolutionary trade-offs between allocating limited maternal resources to fewer, larger, more quickly developing offspring vs. more numerous, smaller, more slowly developing larvae has been analyzed in several models of larval life history. Recent observations have highlighted that in some marine invertebrates, partly developed larvae can spontaneously divide into two smaller, genetically identical clones. Environmental factors such as food availability, pH, predator odors, and temperature can stimulate larval cloning. Clones can themselves clone, significantly altering both individual fitness of cloning larvae and population dynamics of cloning species. I will present the first theoretical analysis of larval life history to consider demographic and evolutionary consequences of cloning, conditions under which cloning is evolutionarily favored, and cloning effects on demographic processes like recovery from catastrophic population losses.","School of Oceanography, University of Washington","Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, University of Oregon",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Grunbaum, D.",,,,,NA,NA,"Emlet, R.B.",,,,,,,,2,No,Population Biology and Ecology,Community Ecology,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,19,,Population Biology and Ecology,

However, measuring diet is rarely as easy as it seems, and methods of assessing diets have their own strengths and limitations. For example, stomach content analysis (SCA) is a direct method of assessing what a consumer ate.  However, depending on the rate of digestion, some prey may be over or underrepresented in diet estimates. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) may provide additional information regarding the composition of diets within populations. SIA measures diet indirectly but integrates over a much longer period of time. We compared the estimated proportions of various prey in the diet of a well-studied fish species, Black Perch (*Embiotoca jacksoni*) using SCA and SIA. Stable isotope mixing models were used to estimate diet using a Bayesian framework. Using a series of models for three separate populations in Southern California, we compared diet proportions estimated using SCA, models with “generalist” priors that were not informed by SCA, and models with informative priors using stomach content data. The models indicated that prey types such as polychaetes and decapods may be more important to Black Perch than SCA may suggest.

Green abalone were associated with shallow depths (2-4 m), low incline of the reef, high algal diversity, and abundant large boulders with little cobble or sand. High densities of wavy turban snails were associated with low algal diversity and a higher cover of sand than green abalone. Pink abalone density was not predicted by substrate composition or other reef features, but this result could be due to the low densities of this species, which has yet to show much evidence of recovery despite the decades long closure of its fishery.

However, establishing how multiple processes interact remains a fundamental challenge. For example, the demography of estuarine species can vary along the environmental gradients typical of these habitats, but the relative importance of those gradients is generally unknown. We took a novel approach to this question by coupling long-term field observations of the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) in a central California estuary with a state-space Integral Projection Model. This approach revealed that the most parsimonious description of oyster population dynamics involved spatial variation in growth and adult mortality—but not juvenile mortality—as well as spatiotemporal variation in recruitment. These patterns match the available short-term estimates of each of those processes from field studies, and reveal a synthetic view of oyster population dynamics. Larval recruitment has an interannual ‘boom and bust’ pattern, and during good recruitment years most larvae settle in the inner bay where water residence time is highest. Adult oyster mortality is also highest in the inner bay, where several invasive predators are abundant and lowest in the mid-bay, where oyster growth is greatest (due to bottom-up factors), likely leading to a size refuge from native predators.

Along the rocky coastlines of the Northeast Pacific, bull kelp Nereocystis luetkeana is a conspicuous dominant canopy species characterized by an annual cycle of rapid growth and senescence. Despite its high abundance, few efforts have been made to quantify Nereocystis population productivity and provide empirically-based estimates that could be used to understand short and long-term change. For the past three years (2016-2018) the Hakai Institute has collected detailed Nereocystis data at three sites on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada throughout each growing season. Using data from fixed Nereocystis transects, including kelp density, size structure, individual stipe and blade growth and individual survival based on mark-recapture, we constructed an empirically-derived model of Nereocystis productivity dynamics in an integrated Bayesian hierarchical framework. Our combined empirical and statistical methodology provides a novel illustration of how Nereocystis productivity varies among reefs, years, and seasons. The resulting models can be used to inform bioregional estimates of kelp production, and assess how abiotic and biotic drivers of growth, mortality, recruitment and survival ultimately contribute to spatial and temporal trends in Nereocystis population dynamics and productivity.","Department of Biological Science, Florida State University",Hakai Institute,"School of Resource and Environmental Management, Simon Fraser University",Hakai Institute,Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada,,,,,NA,NA,Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada,,,,"Okamoto, D.K.",,,,,NA,NA,"Pontier, O","Burt, J","Hessing-Lewis, M.","Stewart, H","Krumhansl, K",,,,6,Yes,Population Biology and Ecology,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,20,,Population Biology and Ecology,

For example, in high-risk environments, individuals that exhibit greater vigilance and/or reactivity may be better at avoiding predators and thus have a fitness advantage over less vigilant individuals.  In low-risk environments, vigilance/reactivity may be a disadvantage for fitness if it results in fewer opportunities to feed.  Marine fish often behave differently in high- and low-risk environments, but it is not clear whether such differences in behavior are innate or learned. We tested whether black surfperch (*Embiotoca jacksoni*) from high- and low-risk populations exhibited differences in reactivity.  In field surveys, surfperch in high-risk locations had larger Flight Initiation Distances than surfperch in relatively low-risk locations.  In a test of whether these behavioral differences are inherited, we collected pregnant fish from a high-risk population (Santa Catalina Island) and a low-risk population (Palos Verdes). In this “common garden” experiment, we compared the behaviors of lab-born offspring.  Fish from the high-risk population exhibited greater reactivity, had higher swimming velocities, and spent less time sheltering than fish from the low-risk population.  These results suggest that consistent, behavioral differences may evolve in response to spatial differences in predation risk.","California State University, Long Beach","California State University, Long Beach",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Satterfield, D.R.",,,,,NA,NA,"Johnson, D.W.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Behavioral Ecology,Population Biology and Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,20,,Population Biology and Ecology,

Therefore, our understanding of the processes that promote or disrupt marine kin aggregations, and when they are likely to be important determinants of genetic diversity, inbreeding depression, and population productivity, remain naïve. This talk presents results from a series of field and lab experiments on a model bryozoan that addresses this gap. Direct estimates of larval dispersal in the field revealed that most larvae settle within meters of the parent colony. We genotyped 189 individuals from two field sites at 2,352 SNP loci to estimate the spatial structure and scale of pairwise genetic relatedness. Field experiments that manipulated larval dispersal showed that spreading sibling larvae increased progeny survival, regardless of competition from conspecifics, and that competition among siblings reduced progeny survival.

Subsequent genetic analyses revealed that yelloweye rockfish *Sebastes ruberrimus* in PSGB were genetically differentiated from individuals on the outer coast; while canary rockfish *S. pinniger* did not show any population structure among these geographic regions. These results confirmed the listing status of yelloweye rockfish in PSGB as a “distinct population segment” (DPS), but suggested that canary rockfish in PSGB were not a DPS, which led to their removal from the endangered species list. Here, we test whether larval dispersal could be a mechanism for the differences observed in population structure between these species. We used an oceanographic model to track larvae of each species released from sites inside and outside of the PSGB DPS during species-specific parturition months. Results were similar among both species. Larvae released from sites outside the DPS rarely settled within the boundaries of the DPS and larvae released from sites within the PSGB DPS rarely settled outside of the boundaries of the DPS. Within each species, we found relatively no differences in the proportion of larvae settling inside vs. outside the DPS depending on the day of parturition (1-60 days) or the age of settlement (90-120 days).

We assembled a team of geneticists, ecologists, and physical oceanographers to estimate and explain patterns of population connectivity of the kelp rockfish,*Sebastes atrovirens*. We developed and applied microhaplotype markers designed for pedigree inference to match parents, offspring and siblings. We combined population surveys (density and size) and habitat maps to estimate patterns of local larval production. We created local-scale ocean circulation (ROMS) models with which we modelled dispersal trajectories from sampled source populations to evaluate whether observed dispersal patterns could be explained by circulation patterns. Of 1912 adults and 4250 recently settled pelagic juveniles genetically analyzed, we detected eight parent-offspring pairs and 25 full-sibling pairs across the study region and period. We found that estimated patterns of dispersal and connectivity differed markedly between years, and that local populations were both self-replenishing and contributed to replenishment elsewhere. ROMS-based dispersal models yielded broad regional dispersal with modeled settlement patterns consistent with observed results though different in timing and magnitude.  These results are the first to empirically identify dispersal patterns along the open coast of North America and demonstrate that populations within marine protected areas (MPAs) can both be self-replenishing and replenish other MPAs and the fished populations around them.","Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, UC Santa Cruz","National Marine Fisheries Service, Santa Cruz","Ocean Sciences, UC Santa Cruz","National Marine Fisheries Service, Santa Cruz","Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, UC Santa Cruz",,,,,NA,NA,"Ocean Sciences, UC Santa Cruz

Of the studies that have examined sublethal effects of predators on reproduction in marine fishes, most have been conducted in laboratory settings, but very few have tested these effects in nature. We evaluated how sustained risk cues from predatory fishes may influence reproductive output in the bluebanded goby, *Lythrypnus dalli*. We conducted a series of subtidal field experiments at Santa Catalina Island, California using artificial reefs and exclusion cages to manipulate the degree of predator presence (low, medium, and high) perceived by gobies. Short-term experiments (1 week) showed that gobies in high-risk environments laid 33% fewer eggs than gobies in low or medium-risk environments. Similar effects persisted during long-term experiments (1 month), suggesting that high-risk environments have the potential to permanently reduce fitness in bluebanded gobies. Our results imply that sublethal predator effects on reproductive output may be substantial in nature. Furthermore, this study will help us understand how practices affecting predator abundance (e.g. overharvesting or protecting) may alter reproductive output and fitness of prey in the marine environment.","California State University, Northridge","California State University, Northridge",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Jarvis, G.C.",,,,,NA,NA,"Steele, M.A.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,"Reproduction, Dispersal, and Recruitment",Fisheries Ecology,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,21,,"Reproduction, Dispersal, and Recruitment",

In systems with strong latitudinal gradients in spawning time (or larval release) and settlement, regional scale connectivity can also be estimated by spatial variation in the correlations among these events.  I monitored the timing of larval release in 9 barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*) populations in the Gulf of Maine and the temporal patterns of settlement in a subset of 7 of these populations in 2017.  Populations were distributed inshore of two different oceanographic regimes; the Eastern and Western Maine coastal current systems (EMCC vs. WMCC).  Laboratory estimates of pelagic larval duration were combined with cross-correlation analyses to infer connectivity from timing data.  Larval release data indicated two gradients in spawning time that ran in opposite directions along the coast.  Settlement was bimodally distributed in the south, grading into a unimodal distribution further north.  Cross-correlation results suggest that early season settlement in populations inshore of the WMCC was driven by larval supply from populations in that same region, but late season settlement was derived from natal population associated with the EMCC.  By contrast, settlement inshore of the EMCC was entirely derived from natal populations within that same region.  Although this approach does not fully resolve population-level connectivity patterns, it is cheap and simple and regional scale patterns may be adequate for many management purposes.","The Downeast Institute

This explains the anomalous presence of species there that are otherwise rarely seen south of PC. An example is *Nuttallina californica*, which is one of the most common grazers in central California, but is replaced mostly by *N. fluxa* in southern California south to Baja California Sur. We have confirmed by field observations and DNA sequencing that both chiton species are present near Santo Tomás, one of the cool upwelling sites south of Ensenada. Specifically, *N. californica* dominates a highly-exposed headland, whereas *N. fluxa* is common in the protected but immediately adjacent bay habitat. We propose that the observed distribution patterns at the Santo Tomás site reflect successful *N. californica* recruitment south of PC and also previously undocumented habitat preferences for each species. Likewise, within southern California, *N. californica* appears restricted to the tips of exposed headlands, such as at Point Dume in Malibu. In contrast, we have not found *N. fluxa* anywhere north of PC. Further study is needed to assess whether there are competitive interactions between these species in the transition in degree of wave exposure where they do co-occur, and whether relaxation of the south-flowing California Current might lead to episodic recruitment of *N. fluxa* north of PC.",Cal State Fullerton,Cal State Fullerton,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Eernisse, D.J.",,,,,NA,NA,"Hood, N.Z.",,,,,,,,2,Yes,"Reproduction, Dispersal, and Recruitment",Evolutionary Biology,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,21,,"Reproduction, Dispersal, and Recruitment",

However, it may be possible to circumvent this trade-off through compensatory behaviors that diminish a selective pressure. Larval crabs can adjust their pigmentation, potentially enabling them to respond to the dominant threat at the moment. Furthermore, crab larvae could descend to deeper waters to avoid UVR. We tested the ability of *Pachygrapsus crassipes* larvae to adjust their pigmentation in response to 4 UVR treatments (shade, visible light, visible + UVA, visible + UVA + UVB) and fish cue. We also tested the vertical swimming behavior of *P. crassipes* and *Hemigrapsus oregonensis* larvae in response to the 4 UVR treatments and sun intensity. *P. crassipes* larvae expanded chromatophores in response to visible light and UVR but showed no clear response to fish cues. *P. crassipes* avoided surface waters as sun intensity increased but was attracted to UVR, while *H. oregonensis* was attracted to increasing sun intensity but showed little reaction to UVR treatments. The attraction of *P. crassipes* to UVR may be related to their darker pigmentation than *H. oregonensis*, protecting them from UVR and enabling them to exploit surface waters.

Cruises mapped larval fish distributions horizontally and vertically through the water column revealing distinct depth preferences by fish larvae avoiding the advective surface layer, and cross-shelf patterns with the vast majority of larvae of most species found within 4 km of shore.

To understand how kelp and phytoplankton alter nearshore seawater carbon chemistry, we investigated relationships between phytoplankton and kelp growth and patterns of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). DIC, phytoplankton, and fluorescence (proxy for Chl a) were monitored twice weekly during summer 2018 at paired rocky (7 – 10 m depth) and offshore sandy sites (14 – 16 m depth) at wave-exposed and protected locations in Monterey, CA. At the wave-protected site where kelp was present, kelp growth was measured weekly. Surface DIC ranged from 1940 to 2090 µmol kg-1 and was almost always lowest at the protected rocky site, likely due to consistently high kelp growth. Bottom DIC ranged from 2010 to 2200 µmol kg-1 and was generally higher than at the surface. Bottom and surface DIC were similar among sites when all sites were vertically mixed, indicating that mixing may obscure the potential kelp growth signal. A mid-July slight decrease in surface DIC may be linked to a slight increase in surface fluorescence and temperature at the same time. Shallow rocky sites were more often well mixed than at the offshore sites, yet surface fluorescence and phytoplankton community composition were similar.  The similarity of the phytoplankton community and fluorescence among sites despite differences in DIC indicates that physical conditions, such as upwelling and water residence time, and kelp growth may be important in affecting nearshore DIC and kelp forests may play a role in ameliorating ocean acidification.","California State University, Northridge",Stanford University,Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute,Stanford University,Stanford University,,,,,NA,NA,"California State University, Northridge",,,,"Traiger, S.B.",,,,,NA,NA,"Hirsh, H.K.","Takeshita, Yui","Mucciarone, D.A.","Dunbar, R.","Nickols, K.",,,,6,Yes,Special Topic: Ecosystems as Coastal Resilience Mechanisms,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,23,,Special Topic: Ecosystems as Coastal Resilience Mechanisms,

Combining multiple native habitats in a living shoreline design may be an ideal method of restoring natural structures for estuarine species. This study investigates the effects of paired oyster and seagrass restoration on fish and infaunal invertebrates. Beds of native Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) and eelgrass (Zostera marina) were restored, both separately and paired, at four sites in Newport Bay, CA. Infauna were monitored via sediment cores collected pre- and post-restoration. The fish community was assessed with video monitoring and quadrat sampling. I predicted that infauna would die back directly beneath oyster beds, but that eelgrass could enhance the community, offsetting these losses in paired habitats. I expected fish abundance and diversity to be greater in restored treatments than in controls and greatest in paired treatments. Results show significant shifts in infaunal community composition post-eelgrass restoration, including increased abundance and species richness at some sites. Oyster restoration resulted in infaunal diebacks only beneath beds as predicted. Eelgrass beds attract different communities of fish, potentially by providing food and refuge, and interstitial spaces of oyster beds attract numerous larval fish. Overall, the study supports pairing oyster and eelgrass beds as an ecologically effective restoration method.","Department of Biological Sciences, California State University at Long Beach","Department of Biological Sciences, California State University at Long Beach","Department of Biological Science, California State University Fullerton",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Howard, Marjorie E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Whitcraft, Christine R.","Zacherl, Danielle",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Special Topic: Ecosystems as Coastal Resilience Mechanisms,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,23,,Special Topic: Ecosystems as Coastal Resilience Mechanisms,

However, the structure, function and resilience of these forests are being affected by increases in the frequency and magnitude of storms, heat waves, and hypoxia events. Communities living at the edge of distribution are generally considered to be more susceptible to these changes. Between 2014 and 2016 a warm sea surface temperature anomaly hit Baja California, causing the disappearance of the biogenic structure that Macrocystis pyrifera provides for other species. The goal of this study is to describe the response of rocky sub-tidal reef communities to the reappearance of the forest when the normal thermal conditions and the M. pyrifera populations were reestablished in Punta Eugenia, Baja California Sur, near the southern distribution limit for M. pyrifera in the northern hemisphere. Our results show an alternating dominance between M. pyrifera and Sargassum muticum during the reestablishment of the normal thermal conditions. An analysis through rarefaction curves illustrates that while the ecological richness of invertebrates increases after the reappearance of the forest, the abundance of fishes seems to decrease, despite no clear changes in species diversity. Understanding the ecological succession of these ecosystems is essential to better inform the decision-making process for their management and conservation.",UABC,UABC,UABC,UCSC,UCLA,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"De la Cruz, E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Beas, R.","Lorda, J.","Kroeker, K.J.","Cavanaugh, K.",,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Special Topic: Ecosystems as Coastal Resilience Mechanisms,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,23,,Special Topic: Ecosystems as Coastal Resilience Mechanisms,

Such erosion is induced by wind-generated waves as they interact with the shore. Although some research has suggested that kelp forests may dissipate energy from waves, other studies are equivocal, and few empirical efforts have been positioned well to directly test this possibility. Here we exploit a unique opportunity to definitively examine the capacity of kelp forests to damp nearshore waves, by utilizing an ongoing kelp forest restoration project off the coast of Palos Verdes, California. Areas that were once devoid of kelp, termed ‘urchin barrens’, have returned to thriving kelp forests after managed culling of unnaturally high densities of sea urchins. We are now comparing ratios of wave energy flux across the kelp forest site for conditions both prior to, and subsequent to, the establishment of the kelp, to quantify the overall percent reduction in wave energy flux as a function of kelp density.

Coastal ecosystems dominated by submerged macrophytes have been suggested as potential solutions to OA effects, due to their capacity to reduce total dissolved inorganic carbon and increase seawater mean pH through photosynthetic activity. However, macrophyte’s metabolism, through respiration, can also promote large fluctuations in seawater pH on a daily basis that can have more negative effects on organisms than a constant (or less variable) low pH derived from OA. To quantify the potential of seagrass metabolism to alter seawater carbonate chemistry, and to test how this may affect calcifying organisms living in close association with seagrasses, we conducted a mesocosm experiment, in which we measured water column chemical parameters and the growth of oysters (Crassostrea gigas) across a gradient of seagrass biomass (Zostera marina). Our results showed a positive effect of seagrass biomass on pH during the day (increase up to ~0.2 pH units in high seagrass biomass) and no effect during the night. Oyster growth showed a positive relationship with increasing seagrass biomass and day-night pH variation (~0.4 units in high seagrass biomass), with growth rates differing up to ~50% along the seagrass biomass gradient. No changes were denoted for total alkalinity. This study shows how, with other factors held constant, seagrasses facilitate the growth of calcified organisms, and supports the hypothesis that seagrasses can help mitigate OA at a local scale.",Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California Davis,Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California Davis,Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California Davis,Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California Davis,Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California Davis,,,,,NA,NA,Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California Davis,,,,"Ricart, A.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Sanford, E.","Gaylord, B.","Shukla, P.","Ward, M.","Hill, T.M.",,,,6,Yes,Special Topic: Ecosystems as Coastal Resilience Mechanisms,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,23,,Special Topic: Ecosystems as Coastal Resilience Mechanisms,

In general, eDNA methods break down into two categories: 1) more quantitative techniques to detect the DNA of one or a few known species, and 2) more qualitative approaches to survey broad cross-sections of biodiversity by sequencing millions of DNA strands at a time. These methods offer some advantages over traditional ecological analysis, including increased sensitivity and a reduced tradeoff between depth and breadth of sampling that is nearly always present in the life sciences. It is now possible to survey thousands of species at a time, and to do so across vast geographies. eDNA techniques are therefore especially relevant in the marine environment, which is of course large and often difficult for scientists to sample.

The CALeDNA network aims to study all of California’s biodiversity across diverse biomes, including desert, forest, chaparral, grassland, and littoral zone. Here, we present biodiversity patterns along a 1200 km coastal transect. Samples were collected from 3 coastal habitats (swash, dune, estuary) by more than two-dozen scientists and community members. We recovered 12,420 taxa representing 73 phyla in Animalia (23), Bacteria (35), Protozoa (4), Fungi (8) and Plantae (3). CO1 metabarcoding alone detected 1336 unique taxa among 44 phyla. High richness was found in Arthropods (192), Heterokontophyta (160), Ascomycota (132), Rhodophyta (122), Cnidaria (115). Moderate richness was found in Annelida (56), Mollusca (43), Nematoda (37), Porifera (34), Bacteroidetes (33), and Amoebozoa (29). Richness and occurrence of phyla were correlated (r=0.74). Alpha-diversity estimates were different among habitats within locations (df=5, F=1.45, p=0.001). The coastal bluffs and dunes were the most variable habitats across locations (df=10, F=1.28, p=0.01). A weak correlation existed between species richness of macro- and micro-organisms along the transect (r=0.60, p=0.0002), and within a single habitat along the coast (bluffs; r=0.60, p=0.01). Species identification is limited to those species with DNA barcode references.

There is growing evidence on how this forecasted condition will affect a variety of study species in many different ways (e.g. reproduction, metabolism, transcriptome). Obtaining a ecosystem-wide response to these conditions is a much more complicated task. A way of study these complex responses is by using natural experiments, in which pH – or Omega saturation state - varies naturally across some spatio-temporal scales. The Hood Canal in the Puget Sound is one of such system, where we have collected monthly samples with the aim of linking variation in water acidity with changes in the composition of marine communities. In order to survey the whole community at once, we used environmental DNA (eDNA) and metabarcoding as the method to detect thousands of species simultaneously, and correlate their variation with Omega stress values.

These habitats support diverse food webs consisting of fish, birds, marine mammals, and invertebrates. These communities are highly seasonal, yet the variability in food web structure, and its consequences for energy flow and community dynamics, are not well understood in British Columbia, Canada. An ongoing conceptual synthesis of seasonality in eelgrass systems worldwide suggests that multiple factors drive seasonality in these food webs in several possible patterns. Using over two years of monthly monitoring of three trophic levels, I will report  how *Z. marina* phenology (the timing of periodic seasonal events) covaries with the temporal dynamics of epiphytic algae and epifaunal invertebrate grazers. I constructed a timeline of seasonal events using these data to depict how eelgrass biomass peaks in early summer while epiphyte biomass peaks later. Additionally, common grazers like *Phyllaplysia taylori* have reproduction events that coincide with eelgrass peak biomass, while *Idotea resecata* abundances peak during eelgrass senescence. We will use these empirical observations to test a 24-step conceptual model of seasonality in eelgrass ecosystems, adapted from the canonical model in freshwater systems.

We surveyed mid-latitude kelp bed habitats to determine whether local habitat heterogeneity has mediated changes in community diversity after more than two decades of extreme temperature events, most notably the 2013-2016 heat wave. Local wave exposure conditions were key in determining responses, with some habitats remaining stable and others experiencing near complete diversity loss, leading to local declines without regional extinctions. Wave-sheltered shores, which saw the largest declines, are a very common habitat type in the Northeast Pacific and may be especially sensitive to climate-related losses in kelp diversity and abundance.

To effectively manage the expansion of invasive species, it is important to examine invasions in a community context, since native species may be able to provide biotic resistance via competition or consumption of the non-native species. In temperate seagrass systems, herbivore-seagrass relationships are vital for the survival of ecologically and economically valuable seagrass beds; for example, mesograzers may buffer negative effects of eutrophication by consuming competitive epiphytes. Through a series of experiments, we have examined the relationship between native herbivores and native (*Zostera marina*) and invasive (*Z. japonica*) seagrass in a temperate estuary. A series of choice feeding trials indicated that several species of native mesograzers tend to prefer the invasive rather than the native seagrass, and that *Z. japonica* is actually a more favourable diet for native grazers, enhancing their growth and survivorpship. When growing the two seagrass species in the presence or absence of the mesograzer community in a mesocosm experiment, we obtained further evidence of biotic resistance, as the presence of grazers enhanced the competitive success of *Zostera marina* over *Z. japonica*.

NATURAL HISTORY AND RECIPROCAL TRANSPLANT EVIDENCE,"Life histories of eelgrass (Zostera marina) span a remarkable range from strictly clonal reproduction to annual when all shoots flower and then die. The ultimate explanations for these life history strategies center on annual populations arising in environments with periodic extremes, such as ice scour, heat stress, and darkness. However, no general understanding exists for the proximate information that shoots use to initiate flowering, or the extent to which annual strategies are genetically fixed or phenotypically plastic. 
Published research is consistent with a model of Angiosperm flowering in which environmental cues interact with shoot energy status to initiate differentiation to flowering at the meristem: phenological delays poleward; change in reproductive investment under thermal and nutrient manipulations; and annual and perennial populations whose seeds show either life history under laboratory conditions. 
Yet, within Willapa Bay, Washington, exist multiple annual populations of eelgrass that a) receive similar environmental cues to nearby perennial populations, b) occur in different salinity, sediment, turbidity, temperature, and nutrient conditions from each other, and c) are close enough to perennial populations that genetic differentiation seems unlikely in light of known spatial scales of isolation by distance.

Moderate temperatures (15 and 20C) facilitated the greatest growth and development in juveniles and germlings, while juveniles were able to survive and grow at temperatures (10 and 25C) that inhibited germling development.

Long-term monitoring of the restoration provides insight into dynamics of meadow expansion and the response to high-temperature events. Meadow expansion is limited by light availability in deeper areas and by temperature in shallower areas. These limits interact with spatial position in the landscape to drive patterns of seagrass resilience. High temperature events in 2012 and 2015 have led to spatially variable declines and recovery patterns across two restored meadows. We combined long-term monitoring data with short-term observations before and after the high temperature events to understand the patterns of recovery and adaptability following temperature-induced declines. 

Spatial location modified the exposure of different meadow areas to high-temperature stress. Recovery also varied by depth; deep areas of the meadow impacted in 2012 showed low recovery and in some cases permanent loss compared to rapid recovery and natural expansion at moderate depths. In 2015, the areas of the meadow that experienced the most extreme loss also showed significant reduction in sediment carbon that had accumulated during the restoration, whereas other areas of the meadow continued to accumulate carbon.

These heatwave events have the potential to cause dramatic shifts in marine ecosystems, particularly in intertidal systems that are exposed to aerial conditions during low tides. For example, we observed severe impacts (e.g., bleaching, declines in cover) on intertidal seaweeds associated with several days of sunny, hot weather that coincided with daytime low tides on the northern California coast during the spring of 2008. Even in the low zone on wave-exposed shores, maximum daytime temperatures exceeded 30°C during the heat wave, resulting in severe bleaching of seaweeds. The bleaching event occurred while we were using screens to experimentally reduce temperature and desiccation stress in the intertidal zone, and we found that bleaching was more extensive in plots high on the shore and in plots that lacked screens. The seaweeds that were most severely bleached were highly productive species such as *Ulva* and *Pyropia*, highlighting the potential consequences of events like this for marine ecosystem functioning.

Over two years, we mimicked the warming events of 2014 and 2015 in lab mesocosms, tracking the impact of both warming events on eelgrass physiology through time.  We found that short-term warming events negatively impacts eelgrass productivity, alters morphology, and drains stored carbohydrates.  These changes are detectable for at least 1.5 years after the warming event.  Eelgrass experiencing warming events in two consecutive growing seasons were more negatively impacted, as time between warming events was not sufficient for individual plants to recover.",UC Davis,UC Davis,UC Davis,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"DuBois, K.",,,,,NA,NA,"Stachowicz, J.J.","Williams, S.L.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,26,,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,

It is becoming increasingly clear that marine algae might buffer coastal ecosystems from extremes in environmental conditions (including temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen). These impacts are likely to be proportional to producer abundance and photosynthetic capacity, which themselves can be driven by environmental factors. I tested the predictions that increased algal cover would be associated with decreased temperature (due to shading) and increased pH and dissolved oxygen (due to high photosynthetic rates) across 36 tide pools in southeastern Alaska. The pools were surveyed twice – at the summer solstice and fall equinox – and physical factors varied both between pools and seasons. Evidence for buffering for all three environmental variables was detected in the fall but not in summer, and the relationship to algal cover was largely dependent on pool volume, tidal elevation, and light levels. The potential role of these algae in buffering global changes in temperature and ocean pH will be evaluated with a manipulative experiment, following in the footsteps of my Ph.D. advisor, an inspiring experimental ecologist.","Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine",,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Sorte, C.J.B.",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,1,Yes,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,26,,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,

Epidemiological theory has largely been developed in terrestrial environments; however, disease processes in the ocean have complex drivers. We studied virulence of Labyrinthula zosterae, a seagrass pathogen linked to mass die-offs of the dominant temperate seagrass species, Zostera marina, at regional and global scales, through a series of lab and field studies. Eelgrass wasting disease (caused by L. zosterae) was present at all 16 sites surveyed along the northeast Pacific Coast, with prevalence ranging from <10-100%. Virulence of L. zosterae strains varied among and within sites, with risk of infection ranging from 0-100%. A reciprocal inoculation of eelgrass from two populations showed both pathogen virulence and host response varies between sites. Low sea water temperature in both the lab and field reduced risk of infection and L. zosterae virulence. To examine the impact of virulent L. zosterae infections on eelgrass shoots over time, we ran a three-week controlled experiment. Exposed shoots showed increasing disease severity through time, corresponding with decreased leaf growth and increased phenols. Taken together, our results suggest highly virulent and avirulent strains naturally co-exist. The potential to cause greater damage increases with stress on the host or conditions that favor virulent L. zosterae. Furthermore, eelgrass wasting disease has a detrimental effect on eelgrass health, potentially contributing to meadow declines.","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Cornell University","Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology, University of Maryland Baltimore County","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Cornell University",Prince William Sound Science Center,"Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, University of Oregon","School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences, University of Washington","Shannon Point Marine Center, Western Washington University","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Cornell University",,NA,NA,"Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Cornell University","Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology, University of Maryland Baltimore County","Shannon Point Marine Center, Western Washington University","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Cornell University","Eisenlord, M.E.","Fiorenza, E.","VanAlstyne, K.","Harvell, C.D.",,NA,NA,"Burge, C.A.","Dawkins, P.D.","Groner, M.","Yoshioka, R.M.","Tracy, A","Rivlin, N.","Tran, T.","Winningham, M.",12,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,26,,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,

We used an eelgrass (*Zostera marina*) and Olympia oyster (*Ostrea lurida*) living shoreline restoration experiment in southern California to test if eelgrass epifaunal community structure and predation risk vary between edge types (eelgrass-oyster and eelgrass-unvegetated sediment) and edge proximity (edge or interior). Multivariate community analysis suggested that edge type and edge proximity altered epifaunal assemblages at only one of three sites, and that site accounted for most of the variability in community structure. Similarly, we found that effects of edge type and edge proximity on epifaunal density, richness, and diversity responses were site-specific, with oysters elevating richness in eelgrass at one site. Using tethering experiments, we found that predation risk for grass shrimp varied with edge type and distance from edge, with interactive effects of edge type and edge proximity at two sites. However, predation risk was higher in eelgrass patches adjacent to oysters than those adjacent to unvegetated sediment. Our results suggest that after one year, oyster restoration has had moderate and variable effects on eelgrass epifaunal communities and predation risk. Our living shorelines project is one of the first in southern California, and we recommend that more studies utilize restoration to experimentally test ecological theory.","Coastal and Marine Institute, San Diego State University","Coastal and Marine Institute, San Diego State University",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Griffith, K.R.",,,,,NA,NA,"Hovel, K.A.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Conservation and Restoration,Seagrass,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,27,,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,

There is increasing community and government recognition of the importance of eelgrass in the bay, but there had been little formal action to protect this ecosystem. Nutrient runoff from the Serpentine and Nicomekl Rivers is one of several water quality issues of concern for key habitats in Boundary Bay. We used an approach that incorporates historical water quality data, empirical research, and community engagement to establish Numeric Nutrient Endpoint(NNE) recommendations for local watershed governance. A nutrient manipulation experiment was conducted at a site of high (Mud Bay) and lower (Crescent Beach) predicted nutrient loading from riverine sources. We established 16 plots at each site, half were enriched with slow release fertilizer and half given no enrichment for comparison to ambient conditions. At each monthly sampling we collected all seagrass, algae and invertebrates in a predetermined section of each plot. This included all above ground biomass/shoots of seagrass, detritus, epiphytes, macroalgae, and invertebrates > 500 µm. At Crescent Beach, nutrient enrichment caused an increase in abundance of macroalgae and detrital material and a decline in eelgrass shoot density. There was no measurable effect of nutrient enrichment at Mud Bay. This indicates a difference in ambient nutrient availability between the two sites and suggests that nutrient loading in Mud Bay may have already caused negative effects to eelgrass communities.","University of British Columbia

While there is global concern about threats to kelp forests, information on long term trends is limited and research suggests that trends are regionally distinct. This descriptive study examined bull kelp (*Nereocystis luetkeana*) forest distribution over 100 years in South Puget Sound, an inner basin in a fjord system in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Kelp studies are rare in this habitat type and location. We synthesized surveys and scientific studies along 450 km of shoreline. Over the last century, observations of kelp forests were limited to 20% of the shoreline, along relatively exposed, high current shorelines with coarse substrates. Results show high variation over time in length of shoreline with kelp forests. While there is some uncertainty due to methodological differences among surveys, there were clear large scale patterns in kelp abundance over time. Major decreases were evident in 2 out of 3 subregions and in total extent of shoreline with kelp. The subregion where kelp forests persisted throughout the study period is a zone of intense tidal currents and mixing. The observed losses in these inner reaches contrast strongly with kelp forests at the entrance to the fjord system, which appear stable during the same time period. The distinct trajectory in the innermost basin could be related to factors that are known to impact kelp performance such as sea surface temperature, water column nutrients, siltation, eutrophication and changes to biotic community structure.",WA Department of Natural Resources,Marine Agronomics,WA Department of Natural Resources,WA Department of Natural Resources,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Berry, H.D",,,,,NA,NA,"Mumford, T.F.","Christiaen, Bart","Dowty, P.D.",,,,,,4,No,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,27,,Special Topic: Marine conservation of seagrasses and seaweeds,

Growing numbers of studies describe the composition of and variation in the microbiome of seagrasses.  Assessing the effects this on plant fitness remains challenging, in part due to logistical challenges associated with executing environmentally realistic manipulations. We measured the responses of root and leaf microbiomes as well as growth of plants to experimentally increased water temperature that mimicked recent summer heat waves in duration and magnitude.  The composition of the leaf microbiome changed in response to increased temperature and these changes persisted for over a month after return to normal temperature.  In contrast, the root microbiome exhibited only modest changes in response to warming and these disappeared when normal temperatures were restored.   Changes in leaf microbe communities in response to warming varied significantly among plant genotypes, allowing us to assess the association of microbiome change and plant growth independent of temperature.  The magnitude of the shift in leaf microbiome was positively associated with the magnitude of growth reduction across genotypes in response to warming, suggesting a potential causal relationship, thought the direction of causality is still unclear.

The region contains nearly 10,000 km of seagrass coastline and more than 25,000 sea otters. Recent studies in California and the Baltic Sea suggest that top predators, including sea otters, may indirectly benefit the seagrass, eelgrass (*Zostera marina*), through a trophic cascade. Building off this research we investigated the relationships among sea otters and eelgrass community constituents in southeast Alaska to assess the generality of trophic cascade patterns seen in other systems. Our observations across a gradient of sea otter abundance followed many of the patterns predicted from other studies. We found that sea otters were associated with greater eelgrass biomass and reduced crab biomass and that greater crab abundance as associated with more eelgrass epiphytes. Greater grazer abundance was associated with greater eelgrass biomass, and increased eelgrass epiphyte load was associated with reduced eelgrass biomass. These results support the trophic cascade patterns seen it other eelgrass systems; however, we found no relationship between crabs or fishes with epiphyte grazers, a critical link in the hypothesized trophic cascade. To date this link is unresolved but given the abundance of crabs and fishes in southeast Alaska eelgrass communities further investigation is needed.

However there is anecdotal evidence that eelgrass may respond positively to aquaculture gear in some instances, e.g. having been observed expanding into aquaculture leases following the installation of aquaculture gear.  We surveyed eelgrass beds in Tomales Bay, CA following a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design to experimentally test the impacts of oyster aquaculture on adjacent eelgrass communities and the local environment.  We collaborated with Hog Island Oyster Company to ensure that the installation and maintenance of the aquaculture gear reflect standard industry practices.

Sampling different elevations (e.g. 30, 125, and 250 cm) above surfaces suggests that microplastics are likely re-suspended from given substrates due to human activity. We measured indoor air within four different laboratories and outdoor air across four different coastal landscapes around the CSU Channel Islands campus with a Cole-palmer vacuum pump fitted with a glass fiber GF/A Whatman filter (1.6µm) to quantify the number of suspended plastics.

We focused on mussels (*Mytilus* spp.), well-known filter feeders and bioindicator species that are known to ingest MP in both natural and laboratory settings. Silt and MPs are similar in size and lack nutritional value yet differ in surface characteristics and density; mussels may therefore sort the two abiotic particles from food differently. We investigated mussel filtration rate of moderate to extreme concentrations of MP and how it compares to filtration rates of natural levels of algae and silt. In all MP treatments, mussels ingested and excreted MP. Mussel filtration rate was not affected at low, environmentally relevant concentrations of MP (0-625 particles/ml), but decreased by 63% at high MP concentrations, (>1250 particles/ml). In contrast, filtration rate was not affected by silt treatment over the same range of particle concentrations, all of which were environmentally relevant.

In response to thermal stress, corals can bleach and decrease autotrophic energy acquisition. When bleached, some coral species are thought to shift more towards heterotrophy to acquire energy from zooplankton. This increase in heterotrophy, however, may consequently lead to increased ingestion of other particles in the water such as microplastics (MP). We tested whether thermally stressed corals are at greater risk of MP ingestion by comparing MP and *Artemia* nauplii feeding rates in two Hawaiian coral species, *Montipora capitata*, and *Pocillopora damicornis*. Results show that *P. damicornis* ingested MP more readily than *M. capitata*, but *P. damicornis* only ingested MP when food was present. Under thermal stress, both species fed less on *Artemia* than when in ambient temperatures, contradicting previous studies on the role of heterotrophy in *M. capitata*. These results provide evidence that MP ingestion can vary considerably among coral species and suggest that some corals are at greater risk of MP pollution. Furthermore, these result challenge our current understanding of the role of heterotrophy in thermally-stressed corals, highlighting the need to continue research in this important aspect of coral biology in a changing world.","School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington","School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Axworthy, J.

Oysters on sites using many synthetic anti-predator nets contained more MPs than those on sites without any plastic, but analysis of particles using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy suggested a predominance of textile fibres including nylon and polyester, which are not typically used in shellfish aquaculture.","Department of Biology, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada","Hakai Institute, Quadra Island, BC, Canada","St. Andrews Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, St. Andrews, NB, Canada

Plastics in ocean litter are problematic because they are durable in the environment, tend to attract chemical pollutants, and break down over time into tiny particles which can be ingested by a variety of marine organisms. The small size and degraded nature of microplastics make it difficult to determine the sources, and pathways of transport of microplastics. Even remote ecosystems in uninhabited Protected Areas are affected by marine debris and microplastic pollution. We seek to identify factors that influence the accumulation of microplastics in beach sediments including season, beach aspect, surface currents and location. In a study of beaches throughout Southern California, including in the Channel Islands National Park, we determined that microplastics were common in beach sands and were entering the food web via filter-feeding macro invertebrates. The impact of microplastics is a global issue that requires urgent action to identify and reduce sources of plastic pollution, and to understand its ecological impacts.","California State University, Channel Islands","California State University, Monterey Bay","California State University, Channel Islands",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Steele, C.L.W.",,,,,NA,NA,"Miller, M.R.","Diego, R.",,,,,,,3,Yes,Special Topic: Microplastics,,,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,29,,Special Topic: Microplastics,

Though green crab have been present on the outer coast of Washington and British Columbia since the late 1990’s, the Salish Sea might have distinct dynamics. Green crab was not detected in these inland waters until 2012, and initial establishment was most likely human-mediated, though ongoing spread appears to be occurring via larval dispersal.

Since 2016, the presence of green crab has been closely tracked by a citizen science network of early detection sites, Washington Sea Grant’s Crab Team. Initiated in 2015 in collaboration with Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife, Crab Team partners with more than 200 volunteers, and tribal and agency staff monitors in regular, systematic surveys of 54 sites throughout the Salish Sea shorelines of Washington. A multi-stakeholder approach has enabled a broader scope of early detection than would otherwise be possible, and a robust sampling design that will permit quantification of green crab impacts.

In addition, close advisory partnerships with management entities, including tribes, US federal and state agencies, facilitate communication and coordination of management efforts. Further, the need to manage green crab on an ecologically-relevant scale has motivated a productive collaboration with Canadian colleagues at Fisheries and Oceans, resulting the development of a transboundary action plan that is intended to guide management actions, and mitigate damage to the Salish Sea.","Washington Sea Grant

To support science-based policies and management actions, this project started at the source—the questions and concerns of natural resource managers—to determine how changing ocean conditions are impacting resources and what is needed to understand to best respond. Informational interviews were conducted with 27 State and Tribal resource managers to give a voice to the concerns, needs, and barriers across the state. Common themes were distilled from the interviews to create an online survey that was distributed to a broad audience including NGOs, scientists, and end users, totaling 90 survey responses from over 45 entities. Respondents were most concerned about ocean acidification (70%) and increasing water temperatures (67%) affecting the resources they manage, but pressing concerns varied among surveyed groups. Three primary research priorities were identified: biological responses of species to changing ocean conditions (19.5%), current abundance of shellfish and fish species (14.9%), and impact of large-scale oceanographic factors (e.g., ENSO) at localized scales (11.5%). Barriers, data obstacles, spatial scale preferences, and modeling needs were also identified, and will be used to inform future science and monitoring efforts.

In this talk we also examine how participatory research can bridge divides between basic and applied geoscience, between scholars in the academy and members of historically marginalized communities, and between the places where science is needed and the places where it is typically conducted. We hypothesize that a new mode of geoscience research (MWG), learning from Boundary Spanners experiences with MWG, and refining a leadership development program from our findings, will lead to a scalable leadership tool and organizational structure that can rebrand the geosciences as socially relevant and inclusive of participants from diverse backgrounds.","California State University, Monterey Bay",University of Washington,University of Maryland,University of Southern California,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,Corey Garza,,,,,NA,NA,Julia Parrish,Lora Harris,Julie Posselt,,,,,,4,Yes,Special Topic: Science to Action on Changing Oceans,,,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,30,,Special Topic: Science to Action on Changing Oceans,

Northern California’s coasts are on the brink of irrevocable environmental change.  Once abundant and highly productive bull kelp forests have been replaced by vast urchin barrens, leading to collapses in local shellfish fisheries (red urchin and abalone), and notable impacts to seabird reproduction.  Yet these urgent and cascading impacts to ocean productivity remain largely unknown to the broader community.  Common negative messaging—waters are cold, rough, or shark infested—deter people from directly experiencing the ocean. Traditional public engagement methods often lack the urgency necessary to propel immediate action.  
The Noyo Center for Marine Science in Fort Bragg, CA is working with scientists and community partners to raise awareness about the loss of bull kelp forests, the consequences and the potential solutions.  We provide experiential-based learning opportunities to the public to strengthen the ocean connection and enhance their understanding of the science that supports recovery.  Using 3D, 360-degree underwater video captured as part of the research effort shown in a newly-constructed geodesic dome gives the public a compelling, realistic and immersive underwater experience, a unique insight that truly moves people.

We carried out a large-scale 9-yr field experiment by altering disturbance to the giant kelp *Macrocystis pyrifera* and tracking community responses. To distinguish the effects of disturbance frequency and severity, we simulated the repeated loss of giant kelp from destructive winter waves across a background of natural variation in disturbance. Following >200 reef taxa, we found that the frequency of disturbance changed the biomass, diversity, and composition of guilds in a manner commensurate with their dependence on physical (benthic light, space), trophic (living and detrital biomass), and habitat (biogenic structure) resources mediated by giant kelp. Annual disturbance reduced living and detrital giant kelp biomass by 57% and 40% respectively, enhanced bottom light by 22%, and halved the seafloor area covered by kelp holdfasts. Concomitantly, the biomass of understory algae and epilithic invertebrates doubled, while the biomass of clams, mobile invertebrates, and fishes decreased 30–61%. Frequent loss of giant kelp boosted understory algal richness by 82% and lowered sessile invertebrate richness by 13% but did not affect the biodiversity of mobile fauna. In contrast, interannual variation in disturbance severity had weaker, less consistent effects. Hence, repeated disturbance to foundation species can outweigh the influence of less-frequent but severe disturbances for the surrounding community.","Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia","Marine Science Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara","Marine Science Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Castorani, M.C.N.",,,,,NA,NA,"Reed, D.C.","Miller, R.J.",,,,,,,3,No,Special Topic: Taking the Long View,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,31,,Special Topic: Taking the Long View,

Therefore, it is vital to understand the drivers of kelp biomass variability for fisheries, ecology, and conservation research. We have developed a multidecadal (35+ years) time series of kelp canopy biomass across much of the NE Pacific and have used this dataset to identify several important abiotic and biotic drivers which operate over various time scales. Low frequency climate oscillations, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation have been recognized as drivers of kelp biomass variability. However recent unprecedented marine warming events have been implicated in kelp declines and have challenged our ability to distinguish whether these decreases are part of natural marine climate cycles. Here we use this kelp biomass dataset to examine low frequency patterns over multiple temporal scales to tease apart fluctuations associated with marine climate cycles from longer-scale trends. We also investigate whether these trends exist at local scales (1 km) or manifest as regional scale changes which may be more indicative of global change effects.

A recent comparison of these features shows that the two assemblages are fundamentally different. Only 4 of >520 macrofaunal taxa were observed among ?150 megafaunal taxa ID’d. The latter are generally poorly sampled or ignored in standard infaunal studies. Although mean numbers of macrofaunal organisms were ?80 times higher than for sedentary megafaunal organisms, estimates for mean biomass and secondary production indicate that the megafauna contribute >4 times more energy to higher trophic levels. Megafauna live nearly 8 times longer than macrofauna, on average. Megafaunal dominants, which include many important ecosystem engineers, are likely far more stable than macrofauna.
The comparisons indicate that studies limited to macrofauna severely undervalue total infaunal resources and demonstrate our lack of knowledge regarding major attributes that should be used to describe infaunal assemblages. They also suggest that megafaunal studies likely provide greater insight into ecosystem dynamics, have more power to assess response to environmental degradation, and to predict recovery trajectories.
Now, a 2012 USGS habitat mapping report for the area suggests that the rich megafaunal assemblages documented in 1974 may have disappeared.

However, the validity and reliability of historical baselines can be compromised if the ecosystem has already been degraded and/or modified by anthropogenic activities. In Washington state, restoration of native oysters is limited by shifting baselines and the lack of information of Olympia oyster populations before they collapsed in the late 1800s due to over-exploitation. Conservation Paleobiology is an emerging multidisciplinary field that aims to use recent fossil and archeological records to develop historical baselines and support conservation and restoration strategies. For this study, I will compile information from historical assemblages to increase our understanding on what healthy oyster beds looked like in the past. Preserved oyster beds can help us learn about species diversity, biotic interactions, and habitat provision to other organisms. Important metrics for oyster restoration such as oyster density per area and size frequency distributions can also be quantified from preserved oyster beds. At the individual level, oyster shells function as archives of proxies such as water temperature, salinity and pH at the time organisms were alive and depositing their shells. These proxies can be quantified through stable isotopes and radiocarbon dating. Increased collaboration between paleobiologists, ecologists and restoration managers and practitioners will help improve conservation and restoration efforts for Olympia oysters.","School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, and

Studies typically demonstrate reduced body size over time for one or a few species and pair this observation with a warming trend. However, it is unclear whether these observations support a universal response or instead reflect bias in the publication record. Here we synthesize evidence for intertidal snails, with the ultimate goal of using ‘historical biogeography’ to improve our ability to evaluate climate warming as a driver of body size decline. We resurveyed six populations in California, Oregon, and Washington, using historical records of snail size-frequency distributions. In addition, we collated size-frequency data for seven snail populations from four published studies. Our database contains >21,000 measurements concentrated along the west coast of the U.S. for 10 species. Using the entire dataset, we found a clear signal of declining snail body size (-20%). However, this signal disappeared when we focused on maximum body size (by analyzing only the upper half of size measurements within a population). In part, this was due to considerable response heterogeneity within and among species.

The processes shaping communities are often hard to disentangle as they can occur on long time scales. We examined decadal-scale changes in forests of the long-lived kelp, ""Pterygophora californica"", at 11 sites off the west coast of Vancouver Is., BC. We used shallow sublittoral Pterygophora forests (where waves exclude grazing sea urchins) to control for site-specific factors and compared the age structure, density, biomass, and growth of shallow stands to adjacent deeper stands that recruited after sea urchins were removed by sea otters. The deep Pterygophora stands exhibited narrow age ranges (pulsed recruitment) compared to shallow forests at the same sites. As the modal age of deep stands passed 10 yrs, stipe density declined. By a modal age of 17 yrs most deep Pterygophora forests had senesced but slowly recovered via recruitment. In 25 yrs, the net mean biomass of stipitate kelps (Pterygophora and Laminaria spp.) in the shallow forests declined by ~50%, whereas change in net mean kelp biomass in the deeper stands was not significant perhaps reflecting a patchwork of successional states at the 11 sites. Although growth rates, based on age-at-size, changed slightly on a decadal scale, growth rates in the shallow and deep Pterygophora forests did not differ, suggesting factors affecting growth did not the cause biomass changes in the shallow stands. These results emphasize the importance of considering ecological history and the environment when studying long-term changes in ecological communities.","Professor Emeritus, Vancouver Island University, Nanaimo BC.","Hakai Institute and the Applied Conservation Science Lab, Geography Department, University of Victoria, VIctoria, BC","Coastal Marine Ecology and Conservation Lab, School of Resource and Environmental Management, Simon Fraser University.

This anomalous warming was unprecedented in recorded history with respect to its intensity and duration as SST anomalies in 2014 and 2015 were higher than 3 s.d. (~3° C) above long-term means.
 We used a 34-year satellite-based time series of giant kelp canopy biomass to examine variability in the resistance and resilience of giant kelp forests in California and Baja California to this extreme warming event. Giant kelp forest ecosystems in southern California appeared surprisingly resistant to the immediate effects of this warming event, as the abundance of giant kelp and many associated species remained within their historical ranges during 2014 and 2015. However, this warming may have had a delayed effect on the biomass of giant kelp in some regions. For example, we found that shortly after the warming subsided in 2016, kelp canopy biomass in San Diego was lower that it had been in any of the previous 32 years. In contrast, other regions north and south of San Diego (e.g. Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Ensenada, Mexico) exhibited much greater resilience, indicating substantial spatial variability in the response of giant kelp to this extreme warming event.","University of California, Los Angeles","University of California, Santa Barbara","University of California, Santa Barbara",University of Virginia,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Cavanaugh, K.C.",,,,,NA,NA,"Reed, D.R.","Bell, T.W.","Castorani, M.C.R",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Special Topic: Taking the Long View,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,32,,Special Topic: Taking the Long View,

In recent years, disease has devastated a diverse suite of marine species, including sea stars, abalone, urchins, and fishes. Is this apparent increase in disease due to increased observation and sampling effort, or to an actual rise in the abundance of parasites and pathogens? We examined the literature to track long-term change in the abundance of two parasitic nematode genera: *Anisakis spp.* and *Pseudoterranova spp.* These nematodes are occasionally transmitted to humans and can cause gastrointestinal ailments in people who accidentally ingest worms in raw or undercooked fish and squid. A total of 123 papers published between 1967 and 2017 met our criteria for inclusion, which resulted in 939 data points (552 for *Anisakis spp.* and 387 for *Pseudoterranova spp.*) . Meta-analysis revealed a global 4.7-fold increase in *Anisakis spp.* abundance (average number of worms / fish) over a 53-year period from 1962 to 2015 and 1.7-fold decrease in *Pseudoterranova spp.* average abundance over a 37-year period from 1978 to 2015.

Today, most conservation targets for sea otter recovery are formulated on pre-fur trade population estimates reflecting notions of ecosystems devoid of humans. However, evidence suggests that for millennia prior to European contact, complex hunting and management protocols by Indigenous communities limited sea otters at sites of high human occupation in order to enhance local access to shellfish. The California mussel (Mytilus californianus), is a ubiquitous marine shellfish whose consumption by sea otters increases and resulting size structure decreases as a function of sea otter occupation. We expanded our understanding of this relationship by quantifying mussel size distributions from eight sites on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, varying in sea otter occupation. We then used a shell length to umbo thickness regression to estimate mussel shell lengths from archaeological umbo fragments collected from five archaeological sites in coastal British Columbia. These were used to make inferences about relative sea otter prevalence in deep time. Comparisons of size spectra revealed that pre-fur trade mussel size distributions fit more closely to modern distributions that are associated with low sea otter occupation, suggesting human management of sea otter distributions. These findings further illuminate the conditions in which sea otters persisted, guiding long-term baselines and management strategies.","School of Resource and Environmental Management, Simon Fraser University","Department of Anthropology, Hakai Institute, University of Victoria","School of Resource and Environmental Management, Simon Fraser University",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Slade, Erin M",,,,,NA,NA,"McKechnie, Iain","Salomon, Anne",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Special Topic: Taking the Long View,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,32,,Special Topic: Taking the Long View,

We performed several experiments to determine factors that might cause or contribute to wasting in *Pisaster ochraceus*. We tested the ability of water to transmit wasting, examined what constitutes a lesion on a sea star, and whether salinity, seawater replenishment rates in aquaria, challenge with crude tissue homogenates, and desiccation influenced wasting. These data suggest that observations of wasting in asteroids may be the result of heterogeneous factors, and wasting reported from 2013 to the present may represent a mix of disease and general animal physiological stress.","Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064","Department of Microbiology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853","Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Aquino, C.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Hewson, I.","Raimondi, P.T.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,Speed Talk,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,34,,Speed Talk,

In this lightning talk, I will delineate day-to-day changes that researchers can make and activities they can engage in to make their professional and intellectual communities more supportive of marginalized scientists. Suggestions will include curating opportunities for representation (e.g., panels and seminars) to not only include white women, but also people of color, from the LGBTQ community, and differently abled scientists; actively encouraging underrepresented scientists to apply to positions and for funding by including text that says exactly that in the announcement; curbing behaviors that exclude marginalized scientists; and removing community members who sexually harass and assault colleagues and students. Finally, we must seek out members of other communities whose differences and unique experiences will enrich our own. In a political era marked by strident attempts to preserve a status quo that favors the already favored, it is our professional responsibility to combat this ethos.

Recently, our work revealed that simple movements of coral reef fishes incidentally produce social information that causes fish to eat more algae from dangerous feeding grounds when there are more fish around them. Because unchecked algae can drive regime shifts in coral reef ecosystems, this simple pattern of positive density dependence in herbivory can drive a feedback loop that could have profound ecological ramifications: removing fish (e.g., through overfishing) not only removes individuals that perform a critical ecological function, but it removes the positive influence that these individuals had on the ecological function of remaining individuals. We use simple models to show that social information incidentally shared among fishes can determine both the resilience of ecosystems to devastating regime shifts and the effectiveness of environmental restoration efforts. Our findings highlight the potential for simple individual behaviors to scale up to affect the structure, function, and dynamics of ecosystems.","University of California, Santa Cruz and NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center","University of California, Santa Cruz and NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center","University of California, Davis",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Gil, M.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Hein, A.M.","Baskett, M.L.",,,,,,,3,Yes,Speed Talk,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,34,,Speed Talk,

Mesophotic ecosystems, found at depths where light barely penetrates, remain among the least explored regions of the world’s oceans. Often known for diverse coral reefs, these depths can also serve as refuges for temperate species in tropical zones. Kelp (family Laminariaceae) is one such temperate species that has been observed at mesophotic depths in the Galapagos, Florida, and Brazil, and is hypothesized to be widespread at 60 – 90 m depths in tropical regions globally. Using a highly portable and customizable remotely operated vehicle (ROV), we conducted benthic video surveys at 80 m depth around Isla Espiritu Santo and Isla Cerralvo in Baja California Sur, Mexico. We hypothesized that clear surface water combined with steep bathymetry that drives shoaling of cold nutrient-rich bottom water to mesophotic depths could provide conditions necessary for kelp (*Eisenia arborea*) survival. We also aimed to investigate the hypothesis that similarities in ecological communities at high-latitudes in the Mexican Pacific and the Gulf of California could be maintained by temperate community connectivity below the thermocline in lower-latitudes.

Coral recruitment is a natural process for the recovery of coral abundance and diversity, and even though there is ample evidence that some species of crustose coralline algae (CCA) are key facilitators for coral recruitment, very little is known about the diversity of these algae on reefs. Understanding CCA diversity has been limited by a challenging taxonomy that relies on studies of specialized morphological features that are difficult to see in live plants. We have developed a multi-faceted research program to better understand the diversity of CCA living on Caribbean reefs, how these CCA facilitate or inhibit coral recruitment, and what conditions are necessary to enable the growth and proliferation of CCA. To advance research of CCA we have built a database of genetic barcodes to identify Caribbean species of CCA. We have not only established psbA as an effective gene to barcode unknown CCA species, but have also discovered some intriguing questions about the evolutionary relationships among these species. We have also designed a guide book that is freely available to help researchers identify CCA using the morphology of live plants *in situ* and in the laboratory.

Rafts of ephemeral algae may affect shallow water organisms by creating anoxic conditions as they decompose, or by shading other macrophytes, such as seagrass. In this talk, I present findings that ephemeral green algal blooms can indirectly cause mass mortality in intertidal populations of sand dollars. In July and August 2013-2015, I documented multiple occurrence in several locations in the Salish Sea where large mats of thousands of dead sand dollars (Dendraster excentricus) co-occurred with green algal blooms. I propose that upright-feeding sand dollars become tangled in floating algae as the tide recedes and are unable to bury themselves. Sand dollars above the sediment-water interface are susceptible to high temperatures during summer midday extreme low tides, and experience mortality. Although these events may cause the mortality of thousands of sand dollars, the impacts of these blooms on population viability will depend on population size. Although only a small area of the large beds I studied were affected (<1%), I estimate that the observed blooms resulted in local loss of up to 71% of sand dollars in affected areas.","University of California, Irvine",,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Henry, A.K.",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,1,Yes,Speed Talk,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,34,,Speed Talk,

In Tillamook Bay, OR, inputs of inorganic carbon are a concern due to oyster aquaculture in the bay and large amounts of agriculture above it. The US EPA has been monitoring water conditions in Tillamook Bay tributaries for 1 year, and preliminary findings show increased total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO~2~) downstream of agricultural areas. 
To determine the causes of elevated TCO~2~, changes attributed to land-based inputs must be distinguished from temporal variability and in-stream processing. To measure temporal variability, a day-long time series of TCO~2~ and partial pressure of CO~2~ (pCO~2~) was measured at locations upstream and downstream of agricultural areas along the Trask River. To account for in-stream processing (periphyton photosynthesis and respiration), stream rocks were placed in sealed containers for 7 hours. Initial and final concentrations (Dissolved oxygen (O~2~), TCO~2~, and pCO~2~) in each container were compared to conditions in the stream.
Times series data show that TCO~2~ is lower and decreases more throughout the day upstream. In containers, the ?TCO~2~:?O~2~ ratio is consistent with photosynthesis-respiration stoichiometry at both sites, while in streamwater, the ?TCO~2~:?O~2~ ratio is much lower downstream. In-stream processing can account for most changes in TCO~2~ in the containers, but not in the streamwater, suggesting that there are inputs of inorganic carbon from land-based sources.",Western Washington University,"US Environmental Protection Agency, Western Ecology Division","US Environmental Protection Agency, Western Ecology Division",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Ernest-Beck, A.

Within 1-2 days embryos hatch into actively swimming, non-feeding trochophore larvae.  In 4-6 days in laboratory cultures (at ca. 13 C) they develop eye spots and subsequently shell primordia and settle approximately 7-9 days after spawning (at 13 C).  As they approach competence to settle, they develop a pair of internal crystal-filled patches of unknown purpose in the region of their protonephridia and near the eyespots.  These patches persist into the early juvenile period.  In laboratory cultures juvenile chitons in their first months are photonegative and found on the undersides of coralline fragments.   Observations of juveniles of 3 species show that they take months to acquire distinctive shell and girdle characteristics that allow them to be recognized at the species level.   Juveniles of *Katharina tunicata* are initially white with translucent girdles and they consume coralline algae with ease.  Pigment in the girdle was just beginning to appear after 8 months.  Juveniles of *Mopalia hindsii* did not eat coralline algae but grazed on diatoms living on the surface of rocks.  *Placiphorella velata* took about 5 months to show the beginnings of the extended anterior region of its girdle, but developed some of the adult color markings earlier.

Over the past few decades, however, the rapid degradation of coral reefs due to regional impacts of predatory outbreaks, overfishing, pollution, and disease caught the scientific community by surprise.  And global scale impacts of climate change and ocean acidification were difficult to grasp.  Now many scientists feel coral reefs will be one of the first ecosystems to suffer catastrophic collapse, with climate change as the main existential threat.  Until now, the approach to reef conservation was largely one of simultaneously encouraging reductions in CO2 emissions, while reducing the land-based threats through the establishment of marine protected areas.  The third global coral bleaching event of 2014-2017, which was the most severe and long-lasting of any on record, has shifted this more passive approach to one of intervention, including reef restoration, assisted evolution, and assisted migration. Oceanographic modeling has been a key element in the projections of coral reef bleaching, and in some cases, identifying regions where coral reefs can survive. Now the challenges of ocean modeling are to identify those regions where interventions can be successful. This talk will cover how ocean modeling has been applied to reef conservation, alongside other interventions that can be used into the future to minimize reef collapse.","Climate & Global Dynamics, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder CO",,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Kleypas, J.A.",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,1,No,Student Symposium,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",1,99,,Student Symposium,

Typically, they passively feed on algal detritus delivered to cracks and crevices they inhabit, however, when detritus becomes limiting, urchins shift their behavior to actively graze on live macroalgae. Active sea urchin grazing has manifest recently along the central coast of California, shifting once continuous forests to patches of sea urchin ‘barrens’ that are void of giant kelp. In order to quantitatively characterize how these changing behaviors influence the algae they consume, we conducted extensive subtidal sampling to determine urchin diet composition in sea urchin barrens and forested locations. However, an empirical approach to classifying and quantifying consumed algae in sea urchin diets does not exist. Therefore we conducted a laboratory trial, feeding Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, purple sea urchins, a strict one-prey item diet. Urchins were then dissected at varying time intervals and their stomach contents were analyzed under a dissecting photo microscope in order to characterize the different digestive stages of each prey item. With these photos we have developed a method to analyze the stomach contents of S. purpuratus from the field, thus allowing us to better understand their diets and influence on kelp forests.","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Jarman, C.N.",,,,,NA,NA,"Smith, J.G.","Carr, M.H.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Marine organisms with planktonic larval stages are especially vulnerable since they have minimal mechanisms of defense and experience large variations in environmental parameters, such as temperature. *Lytechinus pictus*, the painted sea urchin, has a biogeographic range that spans from central California to Ecuador. Little is known about *L. pictus*’s thermal tolerance limits and extent for plasticity. Here, we investigated thermal tolerance and heat shock protein expression of *L. pictus* larvae in the pluteus life stage. Urchins were collected in the Santa Barbara Channel, spawned and reared at 17°C or 20°C. Larvae were then subjected to a gradient of temperatures ranging from 22°C to 35°C to examine high-temperature induced mortality rates. Separate larvae were heat shocked at 25°C, 28°C, 30°C, and 31°C for gene expression analysis via qPCR. Thermal tolerance data shows 100% mortality at 31°C, indicating the upper threshold of *L. pictus*’s thermal limits. Interestingly, this is similar to *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*, a more temperate urchin also found in central California. Gene expression analysis reveal increases in *hsp70* and *actin* expression between 25°C and 28°C, regardless of rearing temperature, suggesting there is no plasticity in thermal tolerance abilities based on previous larval thermal experiences.

Over time, the water-soluble fraction of creosote diffuses out of the wooden dock pilings and into the surrounding water, where the larvae of resident species such as the lined shore crab *Pachygrapsus crassipes* may be harmed. Furthermore, creosote may exhibit increased toxicity when exposed to UV radiation by generating reactive oxygen species. We investigated toxic and phototoxic effects of aqueous creosote on the swimming behavior of the larvae. Larvae were exposed to creosote concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 5.0 mg/L for 20 hours, and to 0.1 to 2.0 mg/L alone for 2 hours with the addition of an artificial UV-B light for 110 minutes (emission of 86 µW/cm3 UV-B), with recovery monitored for 10 hours after removal from the UV source. Creosote alone had significant toxic effects on the swimming behavior of *P. crassipes* larvae after 20 hours (EC50 = 1.07 mg/L). In the presence of UV-B light, the toxicity of creosote increased by over three times (EC50 without UV = 0.523 mg/L, EC50 with UV = 0.168 mg/L). Interestingly, larvae showed some recovery 10 hours after removal from the UV source. Impaired larval swimming due to creosote exposure could subject them to more intense predation and improper placement in the water column, with detrimental effects on population size. The recovery shown indicates that harm from creosote phototoxicity is not absolute. In the environment, larvae may take advantage of this by altering their location to avoid UV radiation.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, UC Davis","Bodega Marine Laboratory, Graduate Group in Ecology, UC Davis","Bodega Marine Laboratory, UC Davis","Bodega Marine Laboratory, UC Davis","Bodega Marine Laboratory, Departments of Environmental Toxicology and Nutrition, UC Davis",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Tjeerdema, E.R.",,,,,NA,NA,"Bashevkin, S.M.","Vines, C.A.","Fairbairn, E.A.","Cherr, G.N.",,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

The physiological response of corals to fluctuating seawater pH provides insight into their ability to tolerate environmental conditions that are likely to occur in the future. We measured gross photosynthesis and calcification of the individuals of a coral, *Acropora retusa*, that had been exposed to both ambient (~400µatm) and elevated (~1000µatm) *p*CO~2~; nubbins were first exposed to elevated *p*CO~2~ for 19 d and then ambient *p*CO~2~ for 11 d. During the initial 19 d treatment period photosynthetic rates were ~1.3x higher than nubbins exposed to ambient *p*CO~2~. Calcification measured on a time scale of hours (short-term calcification) was not significantly affected by elevated *p*CO~2~. In contrast, calcification integrated over a 19 d incubation period was ~30% less for nubbins exposed to elevated *p*CO~2~ compared to those in ambient conditions. When nubbins incubated at high *p*CO~2~ were returned to ambient *p*CO~2~, all parameters measured were similar to nubbins that had not been exposed to elevated *p*CO~2~.

Among the 5 treatments differing in mean pH and pH variability, we found that over 1,000 genes were differentially expressed, providing insight into the expression-level response of marine fish to ecologically relevant environmental regimes.","University of California, Santa Cruz","University of California, Santa Cruz","California State University, Monterey Bay",Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute,"University of California, Santa Cruz",,,,,NA,NA,"University of California, Santa Cruz",,,,"Toy, J.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Kindinger, T.L.","Logan, C.A.","Takeshita, Y.","Bernardi, G.","Kroeker, K.J.",,,,6,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Generating Maps and 3D Models from Aerial Images to Determine Breaching Patterns","The breaching of barrier beaches along the California coastline plays a significant role in regulating coastal sediment supplies within littoral cells. The sediment transported while these barrier beaches are breached is badly needed along California’s increasingly eroded shorelines. Closed barrier beaches choke this sediment supply, exacerbating erosion further down the coast. As sea levels rise, California’s sand supply will become even more important to the continued preservation of endangered habitats and our coastal communities.
Barrier beaches form when river flow and storm action are weak. These weak forces lead to the buildup of sediment, eventually forming a sandbar that results in the closure of the breach. Excessive damming and California's ever-increasing need for water for agricultural and urban expansion has drained many rivers nearly dry, leading to a plethora of ecological issues.
I monitor barrier beach breaching using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with cameras and geographic positioning systems (GPS). 
Change detection was achieved using multiple DSMs, taken over a period of time, and comparing them in ArcMap. DSMs are subtracted from one another to assess areas of erosion and accretion and determine volumetric changes in the beach.
Using the maps and models generated by this monitoring program can be compared to analyze the formation and closure patterns of monitored breaches. These patterns can help us better understand how to reduce coastal erosion using natural forces.

One possible explanation for the sudden loss of kelp forests is the outbreak of voracious sea urchin grazers. When urchin populations are uncontrolled, they overgraze kelp forests, thereby shifting forested habitats to an alternative “barren” state. To evaluate whether the observed kelp declines around Monterey Bay might be attributed to increased sea urchin grazing, we conducted subtidal surveys to estimate the extent of barrens and forests around the region (i.e., current ecosystem state), and to evaluate sea urchin density, behavior (i.e., exposed, concealed) and biomass at depths of observed kelp loss. We also evaluated urchin condition (i.e., gonad index) among three ecosystem states (i.e., kelp forests, barrens and at urchin foraging fronts). Purple sea urchins (*Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*) were found to have the greatest densities within barrens, suggesting that *S. purpuratus* exerts a stronger influence on observed kelp loss (p=0.001). The lower gonad index of *S. purpuratus* in barrens likely reflects heightened hunger demands and starvation, leading to their increased foraging activity and exposure (p =0.003; p<0.0001). Moreover, because only *S. purpuratus* comprise fronts, this suggests that they are fundamentally contributing to kelp deforestation.",UC Santa Cruz,UC Santa Cruz,UC Santa Cruz,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Gorra, T.R.",,,,,NA,NA,"Smith, J.G.","Carr, M.H.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

More recent studies have taken closer looks within mussel beds to measure intertidal biodiversity. In this study, we examined levels of species richness and abundance within mussel beds at different sites with varying wave stresses.

Increasing parrotfish abundance to promote coral resilience is a major priority for many managers; however, heavy parrotfish fishing pressure in parts of the Caribbean remains a challenge. While parrotfishes are primarily herbivores, certain species occasionally feed on corals. Research is needed on the tradeoff between negative impacts of parrotfish corallivory and positive impacts of herbivory to estimate their net impact on corals. Parrotfishes prey upon many coral species, but preferentially target threatened *Orbicella annularis*. There is increasing concern that parrotfish predation may contribute to substantial long-term declines in *O. annularis*. We studied how intensity of *O. annularis* corallivory varies in response to site-level differences in parrotfish biomass, and coral and algal abundance on St. Croix, USVI. We compared five sites on the Northern coast, where fishing pressure is high, to three sites on Buck Island, a well-enforced marine reserve. Additionally, we monitored bite scar healing over time to quantify the frequency and rate of healing in response to scar size and shape and coral colony size. These data will allow us to model the projected long-term loss versus healing of *O. annularis* tissue from a standing stock of bite scars. This research improves our understanding of how differences in parrotfish biomass and benthic community assemblage alter the impact of parrotfish predation on a threatened coral species.","California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo","California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo","California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo","California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo","California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo",,,,,NA,NA,"California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo",,,,"Rempel, H.S.",,,,,NA,NA,"Goodman, M.","Lippert, M.R.","Roycroft, M.V.","VanderBloomer, P.","Ruttenberg, B.I.",,,,6,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Gumboot chitons (*Cryptochiton stelleri*) are a large, understudied grazer on rocky reefs in the north Pacific. They are thought to be thermally sensitive and some populations have been shown to be immobilized by high air and water temperatures (20? and 18?, respectively). To quantify the frequency of exposure to these temperatures in the field, we constructed biomimetic models (aka “roboboots”), which matched live gumboot temperatures within 1?, and deployed them in the intertidal zone at four Northern California sites in summer 2018. Currently, gumboots are infrequently exposed to these extreme temperatures, but do routinely experience air and water temperatures up to 18? and 15?, respectively. Because high temperatures could increase gumboot metabolism and intensify grazing, or could cause stress and decrease grazing, we measured the grazing rates of gumboots exposed to increasing air temperatures (16, 18, 20?) during simulated low tides and increasing water temperatures (13, 15, 18?). Low tides, regardless of air temperature, rendered gumboots unable to graze during subsequent emersion, whereas grazing rates increased in seawater from 13? to 15?, but decreased at 18?. Gumboot’s exposure to elevated temperatures will increase with predicted climate change, which we hypothesize will negatively affect their populations and consequently, their grazing impact on macroalgal communities.",Humboldt State University,Humboldt State University,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"McIntire, L.C.",,,,,NA,NA,"Bourdeau, P.E.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

This state change is most likely due to overgrazing of kelp, and other macroalgae, by the purple sea urchin (*Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*). Urchin barrens are often characterized by encrusting red and coralline algae, reduced species diversity, and higher urchin density compared to intact kelp forests. To determine the potential mechanisms contributing to the creation and maintenance of barrens, we investigated whether sea urchin density or size structure is associated with these state changes. Over the course of our two-year study, 151 sites were surveyed in the subtidal zone of southern Monterey Bay, California. Data were collected on habitat type (forest or barren), sea urchin density, and size structure (mm). Mean urchin density and test diameter were compared between sites using an ANOVA. Urchin densities were significantly greater in urchin barrens (df=177, P<0.0001). Mean urchin diameter increased by 2 mm in the second year of the study (df=150, P<0.0003), but no difference was found between kelp forest and urchin barrens (df=150, P=0.1026). Results from our study suggest that increases in density of purple sea urchins, rather than changes in size distribution, likely contribute to the creation and maintenance of barrens states in the central California subtidal zone.","Undergraduate of the biological sciences at California State University, Monterey Bay","Professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology","Ph.D candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Juliussen, C.H.H.",,,,,NA,NA,"Carr, M.H.","Smith, J.G.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

It is less clear how human activities have affected the diversity of habitats these consumers occupy. Rebounding populations of some predators after conservation provides an opportunity to begin to investigate this question. Recent research shows that following long- term protection, sea otters along the northeast Pacific coast have expanded into estuarine marshes and seagrasses, and alligators on the southeast US coast have expanded into saltwater ecosystems, habitats presently thought beyond their niche space. There is also evidence that seals have expanded into subtropical climates, mountain lions into grasslands, orangutans into disturbed forests and wolves into coastal marine ecosystems. Historical records, surveys of protected areas and patterns of animals moving into habitats that were former hunting hotspots indicate that — rather than occupying them for the first time — many of these animals are in fact recolonizing ecosystems. Recognizing that many large consumers naturally live and thrive across a greater diversity of ecosystems has implications for setting historical baselines for predator diversity within specific habitats, enhancing the resilience of newly colonized ecosystems and for plans to recover endangered species, as a greater range of habitats is available for large consumers as refugia from climate-induced threats.",Duke University,Duke University,"Duke University, University of California Santa Cruz",Duke University,"University of California Santa Cruz, United States Geological Survey",,,,,NA,NA,Duke University,Kansas State University,University of Florida,,"Gaskins, L.C.",,,,,NA,NA,"Silliman, B.R.","Hughes, B.B.","He, Q.","Tinker, M.T.","Read, A.","Nifong, J.","Stepp, R.",,8,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

With few studies on the effects of low temperatures on intertidal ectotherm performance and behaviour, the role of spatial thermal variation in winter has been largely unexplored. One behavioural adaptation ectotherms use to thermoregulate during stressful conditions is to seek out benign microhabitats. In Vancouver, BC, intertidal microhabitats can be the undersides of rocks, spaces beneath macroalgae, and crevices. We examined small-scale spatial thermal variability in the field, along with behavioural responses to low temperatures in the laboratory, to determine the degree to which the intertidal gastropod, *Littorina scutulata*, may be able to use and benefit from thermal refuges in winter. Substrate temperatures within microhabitats are generally warmer than nearby exposed areas during winter low tides. *L. scutulata* is reasonably tolerant of low air temperatures down to 0^o^C, but past this temperature is likely to seek out available shelter. When sheltered within benign microhabitats at low temperatures, *L. scutulata* can regain mobility more quickly than on exposed surfaces. Our results show that sheltered microhabitats in the intertidal zone provide important thermal refuges used preferentially by *L. scutulata* to avoid low-temperature stress. Small-scale habitat heterogeneity in the form of thermally-buffered microhabitats is likely to play a role in determining larger-scale abundance patterns in both space and time.","Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia","Department of Zoology and Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries, University of British Columbia",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Reid, H.

Colonies of *M. capitata* can range from orange to brown color morphs, & associate with algal symbionts *Cladocopium*, *Durusdinium* or both. Here we investigate how Symbiodinaceae type & coral color influence coral growth at different light environments. Coral fragments were collected from a patch reef from parent colonies with a known history of being brown & *Cladocopium* dominant, orange & *Cladocopium* dominant or orange & *Durusdinium* dominant. Fragments from each genotype were placed into four different light exposure treatments using shade cloth: 100% & reductions to 50%, 25% & 12.5%. Growth was measured by buoyant weight every four weeks for three months. Brown morphs showed higher growth rates than orange morphs in all treatments except in the control tank. Also, *Cladocopium* dominant fragments independent of color had a higher growth rate than *Durusdinium* dominant fragments. Insight on how Symbiodinaceae type effects coral growth in different light environments helps us better understand tradeoffs faced by coral because associating with different Symbiodinaceae may have consequences for coral survival if faster growing corals are also more prone to bleaching.","University of Hawai?i at M?noa, Hawai?i Institute of Marine Biology","University of Hawai?i at M?noa, Hawai?i Institute of Marine Biology",Shedd Aquarium,California Academy of Sciences,Hawai?i Institute of Marine Biology,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Opalek, M.L.",,,,,NA,NA,"Matsuda, S.B.","Cunning, R.","Ritson-Williams, R.","Gates, R.D.",,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

However, lack of knowledge about the specifics of reserve geography and rules can lead to actions that adversely affect marine life or disturb sensitive species, even when general support for protected areas is high. We assessed public awareness of State Marine Reserves (SMR) locations and policies on the central California coast. Using surveys, we asked beach visitors whether they had prior knowledge about SMRs. We asked participants to indicate if they were currently standing inside of an SMR and assessed their self-reported likelihoods of performing several actions related to environmental etiquette such as following reserve rules. Overall, 60% of participants had heard of marine reserves. 33% of participants with prior knowledge and 13% of participants with no prior knowledge identified site protection status correctly. Over half of participants self-reported behaviors consistent with reserve rules and environmental etiquette. Beach visitors intend to treat reserves well if they know they are visiting a reserve. However, because less than one third of visitors recognize reserve locations, a disconnect exists between understanding acceptable behavior for protected sites and knowing where to apply this behavior.

In coral reef systems, loss of large predators and mesopredator release can influence changes in abundance, composition, and foraging behaviour of benthic feeding fishes (BFFs) (corallivores and herbivores) which can influence benthic community development and reef resilience. BFFs can benefit coral recruitment, survival and growth by grazing algae competitors, consume and kill corals, and can affect their recruitment indirectly, via substrate modification (e.g. bite scars).

"Glanz, Jess",jess.glanz@gmail.com,2018-09-25 18:23,EFFECTS OF SEASONAL UPWELLING ON TROPICAL INTERTIDAL COMMUNITIES,"Spatial variation in oceanography can strongly influence patterns in near-shore community composition. Evidence from temperate rocky intertidal communities demonstrates the role of upwelled nutrient-rich waters in their structure. However, studies on tropical rocky shores have largely ignored bottom-up factors generated by upwelling and have focused more on top-down control by consumers. Panama is an ideal model to study this because there is regional variation in exposure to seasonal upwelling along its Pacific coast. Here, we examine regional patterns in rocky intertidal communities as a function of upwelling. We compare percent cover of algae, sessile invertebrates, and slow-moving benthic consumers at nine sites nested within the non-upwelling Gulf of Chiriqui, and two regions exposed to seasonal upwelling: the Gulf of Panama and the Azuero Peninsula. To characterize upwelling activity at each site, we measured temperature, and chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations. Results show a striking regional contrast in the abundance of algae and in algal assemblage composition. On the Azuero Peninsula, an open point exposed to upwelling, there is a higher abundance of algae and notably more ephemeral foliose and turf algae. Invertebrate percent cover also show regional differences with the highest abundance in the closed bay of Panama. Our results suggest oceanographic conditions, specifically due to upwelling, shape patterns in the rocky intertidal, consistent with findings from temperate areas. This study highlights the role of bottom-up forces in tropical marine ecology.","California State University, Northridge",Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Glanz, J.S.",,,,,NA,NA,"Urena, M.","Sellers, A.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

This species of whelk can be found in the rocky intertidal zone along with their prey, mussels (*Mytilus californianus*) and barnacles (*Balanus glandula*), another predator the ochre star (*Pisaster ochraceus*), and other intertidal animals. *Nucella* is one of the main predators in the intertidal community, but *Pisaster* is the keystone predator, meaning it has a disproportionate effect on the ecological community. *Pisaster* has recently been plagued with sea star wasting. Scientists have no conclusive findings on the origins of sea star wasting, but know it causes *Pisaster* to convolute, develop lesions, lose grip, and often results in death. As a result of the declining *Pisaster* population, other predators, such as *Nucella*, may be able to increase their predatory effects. The goal of this project is to study the effects of sea star wasting on the intertidal ecosystem, especially in regards to responses by *Nucella*. We want to see if other mobile predators will take advantage of the declining *Piaster* population and eat more prey than normal. Although this experiment is ongoing, we expect *Mytilus* to expand their habitat lower in the intertidal zone where *Pisaster* are typically found, while we expect *Nucella* to take over as the main predator, keeping the mussel bed from completely taking over the rocky intertidal zone.","University of California, Santa Cruz","University of California, Santa Cruz","University of California, Santa Cruz",Oregon State University,"University of California, Santa Cruz",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Gomez, Julieta B",,,,,NA,NA,"Bell, Christy","Anderson, Laura","Menge, Bruce","Raimondi, Peter",,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

These groups typically are prominent members of coral reef communities, but these complex systems include other taxa that can also be important. Sponges provide an example of these “other” taxa, and they are typically overlooked in quantitative analyses of reefs. This study examined the changes in community structure of sponges on shallow coral reefs off St. John, US Virgin Islands, which have been studied since 1987. Photoquadrats from six sites were analyzed for the abundance of sponges in 2-3 y increments from 1992-present, and sponge biomass was estimated from geometric approximations of volume. Overall sponge abundance has increased ~ 25% over 26 years, largely due to Aplysina, but sponge biomass was not associated with this trend. A holistic analysis of benthic community structure consisting of scleractinians (species), octocorals (genus), sponges (genus), and algae (functional group) revealed subtle changes in community structure but not evidence of a phase change favoring sponges. Together, these results show that numerical importance of sponges on these reefs has increased since 1992, although their functional significance may not have greatly changed.",Student,Mentor,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Coblentz, M.C.",,,,,NA,NA,"Edmunds, P.J.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

The project focuses on examining responses of entire suites of reef organisms recruiting to Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) in benthic mesocosms. Twenty-four ARMS units were soaked for two years within a fully factorial mesocosm experiment consisting of four treatments of low and high temperature and pCO2 levels at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. ARMS plates were removed every other month, weighed, and photographed to examine sessile community composition. At the experiment’s conclusion in June 2018, sessile organisms (including sponges, tunicates, crustose coralline algae, tube worms, and bryozoans) were subsampled from all the ARMS plates and DNA barcoded. The plates were then scraped clean, sessile material was homogenized in a blender, and DNA was extracted for metabarcoding to examine biodiversity across treatments. Additionally, images were analyzed in Photoshop to observe sponge species abundance and growth over time and across treatments.

The intertidal mussel, *Mytilus galloprovincialis* is a widely distributed species that is exposed to fluctuations in the intertidal-zone as well as microplastics in its environment. We assessed whether microplastics affect amylase digestive enzyme activity in *M. galloprovincialis* under laboratory conditions. The experimental design consisted of 8 separate glass beakers filled with 1,000mL of sea-water (17?C): 4 beakers were low-food conditions and 4 beakers were high-food conditions. All 8 beakers received the same dose of 10?m microplastics diluted in water to maintain a microplastic concentration of 110 particles/mL daily (below real-world conditions). Our results indicated that enzyme activity of amylase in microplastic-treatments did not differ from those in control treatments in either low or high-food concentrations. Hence, *M. galloprovincialis* did not modulate digestive enzyme activity once subjected to microplastics at low ambient concentrations. This could be due to reduced feeding or compensatory strategies.

To improve their efficacy, we need to understand what drives the success of the resources for which MPAs are designed to protect. For example, California spiny lobster, *Panulirus interruptus*, demographic rates can vary as a function of resource availability. Due to their ecological importance, as well as being the third highest grossing fishery in California, there is a need for management action that considers the resources necessary for lobster reproductive success. Previous studies have shown that sites with a high density of intertidal mussels can support a larger abundance of lobsters and a higher proportion of fecund females. Thus, understanding the energetic dependence of spiny lobster on intertidal prey resources is critical to effectively manage this species. The goal of this project is to use stable isotope analysis to assess the annual variation in spiny lobster diet and evaluate reproductive success in relation to MPAs.  We expect to find that spiny lobster reproductive success will coincide with a lipid and caloric rich diet comprised predominantly of mussels. Therefore, the success of the lobster population will be more dependent on access to intertidal resources than the protected status of the sites.","California State University, Monterey Bay","California State University, Monterey Bay","California State University, Monterey Bay",Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Eddy, T.E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Garza, C.D.","Young, R.I.","Litvin, S.Y.",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Although tomopterids have body segments, these are not isolated by mesenteries as in most polychaetes. They also lack the characteristic chaetae of polychaetes, instead each parapodia ends in two gelatinous flap-like appendages. When applied to previous models for polychaete swimming mechanics, these characteristics should translate to a slow swimming style, yet this is far from true. In order to begin to understand how tomopterids accomplish their fast, maneuverable swimming despite these differences, we used high speed video footage on nine individuals to examine the kinematics of their swimming. We tracked 52 landmarks on each worm as they swam and counted the number of wavelengths, number of segments involved in each wavelength, and the number of parapodia in power and recovery in each wavelength. We determined that the worms did not show significant differences in their basic swimming mechanism, and that the length of each parapodia is changed when in power vs. recovery, while body displacement by the body wave further increases the reach of the parapodia. Likely the change in parapodial length and reach and the difference between number of parapodia in power and recovery at any given point maximizes the difference between thrust and drag. This allows for a high speed swimming style with impressive maneuverability that shows potential as a model for biomimetics in fields such as surgical robotics.","Santa Barbara City College, Santa Barbara, CA

As OA continues to accelerate globally, scientists are endeavoring to find factors that may promote resilience to OA at local scales that are amenable to management actions. Southeast Alaskan ecosystems experience considerable seasonal fluctuations, where water temperatures and pH drop significantly in winter months. Pinto abalone (*Haliotis kamschatkana*) play an important ecological and cultural role in the region and are expected to be vulnerable to OA, especially during winter months when pH is low and food resources (algae) may be scarce. Aquaculture research has shown that a diverse diet promotes growth and has a potential to mediate the negative effects of OA on calcifying organisms. To determine the effects of food resources on abalone responses to OA, we conducted a 15-week mesocosm experiment in Sitka, Alaska. Flow through seawater from Sitka Sound was manipulated with CO2 gas to mimic three pH levels (current summer 8.1, current winter 7.8, and future winter 7.4) and abalone were fed one of two diets: four pieces of Macrocystis pyrifera, or an assemblage of four different algae present in the system. We found that abalone growth decreased with a decreasing pH and a diverse diet acted as a buffer to these effects across all treatments. As Sitka’s oceans become more acidic, compounded by naturally low winter pH and algal abundance, abalone are under threat. This local-scale research can help inform stakeholders how species may respond to global change and may be beneficial to conservation methods in the future.","University of California, Santa Cruz","University of California, Santa Cruz","University of California, Santa Cruz",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Powell, C.S.",,,,,NA,NA,"Kroeker, K.J.","Bell, L.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

This study assessed the ecological consequences of rhodolith bed degradation in areas where rhodolith beds have been crushed by mooring chains off Santa Catalina Island. At three sites, replicate collapsible benthic isolation tents (cBITs) were deployed within disturbed and undisturbed rhodolith beds.  At each site and condition (disturbed and undisturbed), the daily net community production (NCP), community respiration (CR), gross community production (GCP), and community diversity were quantified. Differences in GCP were spatially variable, but along with community diversity, are lower in disturbed rhodolith beds relative to undisturbed beds.

However, many of these declines predate ecological time series data. Without quantitative baselines and historical records of change, it is challenging to understand how intact coral reefs functioned in the past and set appropriate conservation targets. Dermal denticles, the small tooth-like scales that cover the bodies of sharks and rays, are well-preserved in marine sediments and can be used to reconstruct historical shark assemblages. We extracted and classified denticles accumulating in modern and 9-6ka fossil reef sediments in Panama and the Dominican Republic to investigate whether shark community composition has shifted since the arrival of humans. The relative abundance of denticle morphotypes, which correlate strongly with shark ecology, differed between the two time periods in both regions. *Abrasion strength* denticles belonging to demersal sharks (e.g. nurse sharks) increased in relative abundance over time, whereas *drag reduction* denticles associated with fast swimming species that typically occupy high trophic levels (e.g. requiem and hammerhead sharks), decreased in relative abundance. Given that these taxa have different life modes and diets, this shift in the predator community could have altered reef trophic structure. By defining the historical range of variation in shark communities and tracking change over long stretches of ecological time, these new data can help guide rigorous management targets informed by local historical conditions.","University of California, Santa Barbara","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego","University of California, Santa Barbara",Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Dillon, Erin M ",,,,,NA,NA,"Norris, Richard D ","McCauley, Douglas J ","O'Dea, Aaron ",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Behavior in infected and uninfected crabs was measured using righting response and an established ethogram that recorded numerous behavioral types, including those that may affect conspicuity to predators. We found that there was minimal influence of infection on behavior, and that individual crab behaviors remained resilient through time. An exception was a slight decline in conspicuity in the 72 hour post-infection time point, which may suggest that *M. similis* has the potential to decrease predation risk during parasite development in its new host.

Here, we present an educational program, adaptable for a variety of subject classes, which integrates hands-on technology education and a place-based learning approach to empower students to apply chemistry concepts to their local environments. Our interdisciplinary approach is to integrate technological skills and environmental science education, incorporating core ideas, practices, and cross cutting concepts associated with the Next Generation Science Standards. We trialed our program with 5 chemistry classes totaling 96 students at Sequim High School in Spring 2018. Over three classes, students built simple spectrophotometric pH sensors using microprocessors, light sensors and other easily available electronic components. Students calibrated their sensors with known pH standards and a pH indicator dye, then used their sensor to assay the pH of an unknown [environmental] sample. To assess content knowledge and confidence in the material, students completed learning assessments before and after the program. Assessments showed significant improvement in content knowledge relating to the environmental relevance of pH, and the use, design and environmental application of sensors. We found no significant increase in content knowledge associated with basic pH concepts, likely because this method of presenting material to recall as opposed to apply is familiar to students.

There are a variety of stressors that effect the health of *Z. marina* and, by extension, the ecosystems that form around this plant. These stressors include, but are not limited to, eelgrass wasting disease and desiccation. The objective of the present study is to describe tissue conditions of *Z. marina* leaves in Humboldt Bay, California to understand the actual amount of leaf area that could be contributing to the photosynthetic drawdown of CO~2~. This project is part of a larger effort to measure the effects of *Z. marina* on aqueous carbon chemistry in Humboldt Bay. In this ongoing study we have measured the tissue damage of *Z. marina* leaves during the summers of 2017 and 2018 from nine sites in the Bay. A supervised machine learning algorithm is used (Trainable WEKA Segmentation plugin for FIJI) to classify images of *Z. marina* leaf tissue into three categories: healthy, desiccated , and lesion (i.e. necrotic due to infection by eelgrass wasting disease). This method allows us to evaluate the large scale spatio-temporal distribution of tissue damage among *Z. marina* beds. These data will be used in conjunction with measurements of Leaf Area Index (LAI; i.e., m^2 leaf area / m^2 mudflat) to generate an adjusted LAI for each of the nine study sites. This adjusted LAI comes closer to describing functional photosynthetic leaf area and so should be a better predictor of the ability of each *Z. marina* bed to buffer against ocean acidification.",Humboldt State University,Humboldt State University,Humboldt State University,Humboldt State University,California Sea Grant,,,,,NA,NA,California Department of Fish and Wildlife,Wiyot Tribe,Humboldt State University,,"Landaw, L.",,,,,NA,NA,"Shaughnessy, F.J.","Jones, A.","Glazebrook, M.","Tyburczy, J.","Ray, J.","Nelson, T.","Abell, J",,8,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Depending on trophic structure, invertebrate communities in seagrass beds are capable of keeping seagrass leaves relatively free of epiphytes and this top-down cleaning may enhance the draw-down capacity of the plant. The objective of the ongoing study is to describe the relationships between invertebrate community structure and epiphyte loads among eelgrass beds in Humboldt Bay, California. We sampled 4 beds in 2017 and 9 beds in 2018 to enumerate small mobile predators, mesograzers and leaf epiphyte weights. To collect, we used pitfall traps, mesh corrals swept with a dip net, and destructively sampled shoots. Replicate sample locations occur within the high, mid and low transects positioned within each bed. NMDS ordination (PC-ORD 7)  is used to describe invertebrate community structure; PERMANOVA  to determine if there are significant community differences among beds. Analysis of 2017 communities indicates that not all beds have the same trophic structure. A high abundance of particular predators correlates to a low abundance of mesograzers and a high abundance of epiphytes in certain sites, and vice versa. Thus far, analysis suggests that differences in the intensity of top-down control of epiphytes is one of the factors that could cause different beds in the same estuary to vary in their draw-down potential. Our poster will include a further analysis on the 2018 sites.","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA",Natural Resources Director for the Wiyot Tribe,"Department of Oceanography, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA",,,NA,NA,"Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","California Department of Fish & Wildlife, Eureka, CA","California Sea Grant, Eureka, CA","Ureno, G.","Nelson, T.","Abell, J.",,,NA,NA,"Bespalova, D.

To better understand factors influencing natural clam abundance, we examined spatio-temporal variation in the density and distribution of recently-settled clams (150-250 um). We quantified newly settled clams during 2016 and 2017 in 4 regions throughout WA (Samish and Padilla Bay, S. Puget Sound, Hood Canal, and Willapa Bay; n=2 sites per region) using passive mid-intertidal spat collectors (n=5 per site). We examined the effects of salinity (site proximity to a freshwater source), substrate type (pea gravel or crushed oyster shell hash), and porewater temperature on settlement. There was vast within-site, within-region, and among-region variation in clam settlement densities, although patterns were consistent between years. Manila (*Ruditapes philippinarum*) and Eastern Softshell (*Mya arenaria*) clams were the most abundant settlers. Peak settlement timing varied between species and regions, and cumulative *R. philippinarum* settlement reached a maximum of 100,000 ind. m-2 (S. Puget Sound, 2016), while *M. arenaria* settlement reached 30,000 ind. m-2 (Padilla Bay, 2016).

Community structures are controlled by environmental and biological factors. The conditions known to affect zooplankton communities are sensitive to climate change, making local plankton communities important to study. To investigate the diversity and density of the zooplankton community in Monterey Bay, we collected weekly plankton samples in Monterey from 2017 to 2018. We counted and identified the zooplankton to the lowest possible taxon under a dissecting microscope. We focused on the three most abundant zooplankton categories from our samples: copepods, nauplii, and polychaete larvae. We examined the impact of upwelling, SST, and chlorophyll a on the abundance of these groups. We also ask whether these groups have a synchronized response to these factors. We find that the nauplii and copepods make up the greatest proportion of the zooplankton community. Population peaks are typically synchronized amongst the three groups throughout the year, although occasionally the dominant group switches from copepods to nauplii. Categorized into upwelling seasons, there was no statistically significant correlation between the plankton populations and the upwelling index; however, observations show that zooplankton densities during transitional upwelling months are more variable than months typically associated with high and low upwelling. Shifts in zooplankton densities in relation to environmental factors are important for understanding the sensitivity of local food web dynamics in response to broader oceanic changes.",The Santa Catalina School,The Santa Catalina School,The Santa Catalina School,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Partlow, E.

In spite of the ecological relevance of this issue, very few studies have described microplastic concentrations in benthic organisms in their natural environment. This study provides the first record of the abundance of microplastics within three ecological compartments (sediment, seawater, and benthic biota) in a marine reserve situated in a sparsely populated area on the California coast. The benthic community had remarkably higher concentrations of microplastic particles than the environment. Concentrations of microplastics in seawater and sediment were 36.59 plastics/L and 0.227 ± 0.135 plastics/g, respectively. Two species of macroalgae (*Pelvetiopsis limitata* and *Endocladia muricata*) contained higher densities of microplastics than the surrounding environment at 2.34 ± 2.19 plastics/g and 8.65 ± 6.44 plastics/g, respectively, and the interspecific differences in densities may be related to their morphological complexity. The highest concentrations of microplastics were in a primary consumer, the black turban snail *Tegula funebralis*, potentially due to bioaccumulation (9.91 ± 6.31 plastics/g). The presence of microplastics in a marine reserve on the rural open coast indicates how widespread they are in the environment and food web. This study establishes the need for further investigation of the prevalence and potential harm of microplastics in benthic communities at ‘pristine’ locations.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California at Davis, Bodega Bay, CA 94923.

Using sea surface temperature (SST) data recorded at rocky intertidal sites along the coasts of Oregon and Nova Scotia from April 2014 to August 2018, we calculated SST anomalies and then summarized the anomalies with thermal indices to estimate cooling event durations and rates. To describe spatiotemporal patterns in cooling events, we grouped 18 sites in Oregon and Nova Scotia using cluster analyses. For sites that cluster together, we hypothesize those rocky intertidal ecosystems may be similarly influenced by cooling events.

BIOTIC INTERACTION STRENGTH DIFFERS BY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE FOULING COMMUNITY OF BODEGA HARBOR, CALIFORNIA","When habitat becomes available and community assembly occurs, the strength and outcomes of pairwise competitive interactions may vary over stages and across seasons. To study these changes, we digitally analyzed settlement plates submerged in Bodega Harbor, California and photographed regularly for seven months. We measured species abundance over time and transition probabilities, which are the likelihood that one species will be replaced by another at a later time point. We then constructed networks illustrating competitive interactions among all species in the fouling community for multiple stages in community assembly. We found that the dominant species (all colonial tunicates except for the solitary tunicate *Ascidia ceratodes*) changed as the community developed over time, with *Botrylloides violaceus* dominating in early settlement and growth stages, *Distaplia occidentalis* dominating in intermediate stages, and *Ascidia ceratodes* and *Diplosoma listerianum* dominating in later stages. Because dominance networks change frequently, no single network is able to account for the overall pattern in community development. However, poor competitors (such as *Distaplia occidentalis*) may dominate for certain periods, possibly due to additional biotic or abiotic drivers.","University of California, Irvine","University of California, Irvine","University of California, Irvine",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Truong, D.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Henry, A.K.","Sorte, C.J.B.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Although the effects of stressors, such as nutrient and sediment addition and reduced herbivory, on algal turf growth have been studied, no previous studies have examined the effect of macroalgae on algal turf growth in coral reefs. Therefore, we tested the effect of nutrient addition and macroalgal presence, specifically *Padina boryana*, on algal turf height and sediment accumulation over 18 days on an algal-dominated fringing reef in Mo’orea, French Polynesia. We found a novel facilitative effect of macroalgal presence on algal turf height. Macroalgal presence increased algal turf growth by 33.9% compared to the absence of macroalgae, regardless of nutrient treatment. Nutrient addition also significantly increased algal turf height by 127.4% compared to turf without nutrient addition, regardless of macroalgal treatment. Macroalgal presence and nutrient addition did not interact to affect algal turf height. Macroalgal presence also reduced sediment accumulation, possibly by trapping the sediment itself or by a whiplash effect. Coral reefs experiencing macroalgal blooms and/or anthropogenic nutrient additions may also be at risk of developing long algal turfs, which could maintain a persistent shift to a degraded state.",UCLA,UCLA,UCLA,UCLA,UCLA,,,,,NA,NA,UCLA,,,,"SURA, S.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"DELGADILLO, A.","FRANCO, N.","GU, K.","TURBA, R.","FONG, P.",,,,6,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Preliminary data suggest that growth rates are largely consistent across sites, larger alga are found in the mid and lower bay, and protected and exposed sites yield different biomass data. While rockweed biomass has profound effects on the physical environment of the mid-intertidal, the effect of harvest on these physical factors and the biological community are not well known.

We examined the effects of extreme upwelling conditions on the energetic demands of juvenile gopher rockfish (*Sebastes carnatus*) by measuring ventilation rates during a short-term laboratory upwelling simulation. We held fish (n=4-5/treatment) in one of two different treatments, simulating extreme upwelling (7.3 pH; 2.0 mg/L DO) or ambient conditions (8.0 pH; 8.0 mg/L DO) for four days. We then placed the upwelling group in an ambient treatment for an additional five days to simulate a subsequent relaxation event. Ventilation rates were measured in both groups at the end of each phase by averaging opercular beats per minute (bpm) over three one-minute intervals during a 30-minute time period. Fish in the upwelling treatment had ventilation rates ~50-60% higher than the control treatment (~50 bpm; two-sample t-test: p-value < 0.001). After a 5d recovery period, ventilation rates returned to levels associated with ambient conditions (~30 bpm; p-value = 0.11). Exposure to short-term upwelling events is likely to pose a major energetic cost to juvenile gopher rockfish and, although fish appeared to recover within a few days, longer-term sublethal effects may persist. Quantifying the energetic costs associated with exposure to future upwelling conditions can help predict the fate of rockfish populations under climate change.","California State University, Monterey Bay","California State University, Monterey Bay

We measured metabolic rates of hermit crabs (*Pagurus hirsutiusculus*) and mussels (*Mytilus trossulus*) with varying thermal histories. Organisms were collected from 9 tide pools in Sitka, Alaska in which we also recorded temperature over the three months prior to metabolic rate assays. Using respirometry, we estimated resting mass-specific oxygen consumption (*MO*~2~) at three different temperatures (10°C, 18°C, and 26°C) for one hermit crab and one mussel from each tide pool. As predicted, *MO*~2~ significantly increased with experimental temperature and mass. We then tested for linear relationships between individual *MO*~2~ slopes and the following environmental parameters: average, variance, maximum, and range of pool temperatures. For both species, there was a relationship between *MO*~2~ slopes and the thermal maximum and range. However, the direction of the relationship differed between species: hermit crab *MO*~2~ increased more rapidly for individuals from cooler pools while mussel *MO*~2~ increased more for individuals from warmer pools. These findings show that thermal environmental history at small scales influences metabolic response to temperature within local populations and that the direction of the response can differ between species.","University of California, Irvine","University of California, Irvine",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Rangel, R.E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Sorte, C.J.B.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

We opportunistically recorded the attraction calls of mothers (n=4) and pups (n=29) during winter, when pups were ~7 months old. The acoustic parameters of these calls were assessed to determine the cues that could potentially support mother-pup recognition. A comparison of call parameters among individuals showed that fundamental frequency and harmonic interval had high individual variability and thus may support social recognition during the period of maternal dependence. To evaluate possible species differences, we further compared these calls to those of related fur seals (*A. australis, A. gazella, A. forsteri, A. tropicalis*). When considering comparisons within the *Arctocephalus* genus, we found species-typical differences again in both fundamental frequency and harmonic interval.

To ensure sustainability of these species, it is important to study all life stages, especially the larval phase of development, as it is the most vulnerable and cryptic phase. Light microscopy is traditionally used for identification and quantification of bivalve larvae in environmental plankton samples, and is based on fine scale morphological discrimination between species. Error with this method can be introduced when discrimination differs between identifiers, and as morphological characteristics are altered due to environmental conditions, such as decalcification and changes in growth patterns in response to their environment. To validate our visual identification, we are documenting wild larvae from our samples, and then using DNA barcoding to verify their identities. Information from DNA barcoding can help determine the accuracy of our light microscopy classifications. This DNA barcoding will not only verify the results of our current bivalve projects, but will also lend itself to better understanding the ecology and management of these species.",University of Washington Tacoma,University of Washington Tacoma,University of Washington Tacoma,University of Washington Tacoma,University of Washington Tacoma,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"McKenney, G.",,,,,NA,NA,"Becker, B.J.","Parker, H.","Matheson-Margullis, H.R.","McCartha, M.",,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

However, despite extensive study in this area, little is known about how warm-water events affect benthic reef algal communities. We hypothesize that following warm-water events associated with El Nin?o 
Southern Oscillation, the cover of calcareous algae on coral reefs will decline, creating a shift toward dominance of fleshy macroalgae and turf. Here we specifically explore how benthic algal communities change over time on Palmyra Atoll in the remote central Pacific. We use a 9-year time series of permanently marked photoquadrats across both the shallow reef terrace (5m) and the deeper forereef (10m). All images were analyzed in Photoshop where the planar areas for both calcareous and fleshy algae were quantified and converted to percent cover. Our results show that across both habitat types, overall calcareous algal cover decreased in El Nin?o years (2009-10 and 2015) while overall calcareous algal cover increased. Calcareous genera *Halimeda spp.* and *Peyssonnelia spp.* declined in cover during warm-water periods and so may be temperature sensitive. These results highlight the importance monitoring benthic algal populations to better understand how they are likely to respond to global climate change.","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Arzuyan, K.",,,,,NA,NA,"Khen, A.","Pedersen, N.E.","Edwards, C.B.","Smith, J.E.",,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

One of the most successful, invasive macroalgal species in the world, *Undaria pinnatifida*, is native to the coasts of Japan surviving transoceanic dispersal and establishing populations globally. Although nearly cosmopolitan, the life history of this species is not understood well in some invaded regions with illustrations of annual, winter cohort, and inter-annual phenologies driven by sea surface temperature (SST). In addition, the mechanisms of anthropogenic dispersal have not been explored in detail. In this study, we explored the phenology of *Undaria* in San Diego using presence/absence surveys on docks and along breakwaters. Additionally, to explore whether Undaria spores could be viable in the ballast water of ships, we analyzed the ability of zoospores to survive and germinate with and without light across different temperature regimes. Although *Undaria* was abundant during cooler SST in mid-July (18.8 °C), individuals were nearly absent in warmer SST during early August (22.2 °C). A protocol to establish spore release in *Undaria* and experimental methods were established but further work is necessary to determine effects of light and temperature on germination of spores. These findings will aid in understanding the temporal and spatial extent of *Undaria* sporophytes in San Diego and the ability of zoospores to survive and germinate. This will allow for an understanding of global dispersal mechanisms which could aid in management strategies.","California State Polytechnic University, Pomona","Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"McHaskell, D.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Smith, J.E.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Temperature and resource supply are two fundamental drivers of form and function that link global change to local ecological processes. Here we addressed the relationship between these two drivers in the context of biological nitrogen fixation. We used metabolic scaling theory to make predictions about how a temperature dependent nitrogen supply might interact with the temperature dependence of photosynthesis. We also looked for ecological outcomes of this interaction, such as shifts in population dynamics, community structure, or ecosystem function, to determine whether the temperature effects are general across scales.

Calcifying algal groups, such as crustose coralline algae, fulfill critical ecosystem functions in benthic communities, including releasing chemical cues to attract coral larvae to settle, reinforcing the reef framework through calcification, and acting as major producers of calcium carbonate (Kuffner et al. 2008).  As such, the abundance of calcifying algae can be a useful indicator of reef health (Smith et al. 2016).  Alternatively, elevated abundance of fleshy algal groups, such as turf algae, can be associated with reef degradation as they are known to dominate shortly after disturbances, inhibit coral recruitment, compete with corals, and accumulate sediment (Birrell 2004).  To monitor algal succession dynamics following disturbance events, we used permanent photoquadrats taken on Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific to track the fate of *Pocillopora* colonies from 2009 to 2017, as they experienced coral bleaching, mortality, colonization by algae, and algal assemblage turnover.

The inorganic nitrogen available to primary producers is typically separated by source: nitrate (NO3-) represents a spatial subsidy from outside the local system, whereas ammonium (NH4+) is locally recycled and represents an autochthonous nitrogen source. The turban snail Tegula funebralis is a critical player in tide pool nutrient cycling - our previous work indicates that Tegula contributes disproportionately to NH4+ accumulation - that can either feed in situ on algae growing in the pools or on drift algae washed into pools. To evaluate the sources of nitrogen being recycled by Tegula, we conducted field observations of snails grazing on tide pool walls vs. on drift algae in n = 18 tide pools on the central California coast. Tegula grazing on drift algae represented up to 6% of Tegula found across all tide pools at the site, and as many as 36% of the Tegula in some pools were actively grazing on drift algae. Pools containing kelp wrack - a high-quality resource - tended to have more Tegula feeding on drift algae. We measured NH4+ excretion rates of Tegula feeding on drift algae and on rocky substrates and calculated the proportion of excreted NH4+ that represented a converted external subsidy.

Giant kelp’s physical and biological processes impact variability of oceanographic parameters by changing the temperature and oxygen levels. To identify and understand possible relationships between kelp health and water column measurements data were collected on kelp growth rates, kelp canopy condition and extent, temperature, and dissolved oxygen levels within a central California kelp forest. We measured kelp growth rates and condition weekly and kelp canopy extent monthly. Temperature and dissolved oxygen were recorded twice weekly using a conductivity temperature depth (CTD) sensor. Kelp canopy extent was stable over time while canopy condition declined throughout the summer. Following periods of high kelp growth, temperature increased from 12°C to 16°C while surface oxygen concentrations increased from 8.63 mg/L to 11.44 mg/L. This suggests that more kelp biomass traps warmer waters within the kelp forest while increased rates of photosynthesis saturate surface dissolved oxygen levels. Additionally, dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased from 10.96 mg/L to 7.18 mg/L as canopy health deteriorated, indicating that less healthy kelp may produce less oxygen.

In this poster, I provide an overview of how my research addresses this challenge. My dissertation examines how body size, temperature, and biotic interactions together affect intertidal acorn barnacles (*Balanus glandula*) in three connected projects. 1) Currently, I am writing up field and mesocosm results which suggest that temperature and crowding alter the effects of body size on barnacle vital rates (mortality, growth, and reproduction). Body size and crowding had an interaction effect on barnacle mortality in the field, with the positive effects of crowding dependent on body size. This effect was likely due to a shift from net size-asymmetric competition to facilitation (habitat amelioration) with increasing size. 2) Previously, I found non-additive effects of multiple drivers (air and water warming) on an intertidal predator-prey interaction (barnacles and whelks). 3) Next, I aim to synthesize my findings to ask: how do warming and biotic interactions affect barnacle population dynamics? I plan to do this using a size-structured population model (integral projection model).

Pumped water samples were taken at replicate stations representing seagrass beds and bare substrate, at the surface and bottom of the water column, during the day and at night. Samples were analyzed with microscopy for larvae of various bivalves. We predict that larvae will move into seagrass beds during the day and out of them at night, relative to bare stations.

Previous studies have revealed the positive impacts of parrotfish algal herbivory, but less is known about the extent of the negative impact of corallivory. To understand this net impact we studied the distribution of parrotfish bite scars on *Orbicella annularis*, a major reef building coral, relative to coral cover and across a gradient of parrotfish abundance in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. We surveyed four sites: two that are fished and two in a fully-protected no take marine reserve with high parrotfish biomass. Divers conducted photo surveys of *O. annularis* colonies and of the standing stock of bite scars on them. We analyzed photos in ImageJ to measure scar size and colony area and used these data to generate estimates of scar density relative to the total area of live *O. annularis* and area of reef. We also surveyed the parrotfish assemblage to determine density, biomass, and species composition at each site. Preliminary data suggests a correlation between increased parrotfish density and increased scar density. Further studies that combine these standing stock data with long-term scar healing rates will allow us to quantify the relative impact of corallivory from a snapshot survey of bite scar distribution.

Giant kelp forests are characterized by a high biodiversity of organisms such as invertebrate grazers, which transfer primary productivity up the food web and can drive dramatic changes in kelp biomass, performance, and populations. Currently, there is a gap in understanding the implications of climate change stressors on  the physiology and behavior of key kelp forest grazers. To address this, we are comparing grazing rates on adult *Macrocystis pyrifera* across five common kelp grazers in laboratory experiments using a combination of two levels of dissolved oxygen (7.5 mg/L and 2.0 mg/L) and pH (7.9 and 7.4).

Ctenes are a model system for studying the kinematics of drag-based propulsion due to their large size and beat cycle akin to that of an individual cilium. Ctene kinematics have been well described at the level of an individual ctene but there is little information about kinematics and swimming performance at the organismal scale. This study attempts to fill that gap by assessing kinematic and morphological factors affecting swimming performance in the ctenophore *Pleurobrachia bachei* using high speed videography. Here we show that *P. bachei* swimming speed is strongly modified by ctene beat frequency regardless of body length. However, there is not a significant relationship between body length and swimming speed, which may be driven by allometric constraints. Ctene bending at inflection points between 56% and 74% of ctene length significantly enhance swimming speed. Separation of the ctene into two clumps of cilia increases during the effective stroke and decreases during recovery. We argue that separation increases the drag of the ctene during the effective stroke, thus increasing the thrust produced. This separation contributes to ctenes remaining an effective propulsive structure at intermediate Reynolds numbers. Our results demonstrate the relationship between ctene kinematics and swimming performance in *P. bachei* and present novel observations of ctene morphology, thus adding to knowledge about ctene kinematics and ctenophore swimming performance.","Western Washington University, Bellingham, Washington","Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene Oregon","Department of Marine Biology and Environmental Science, Roger Williams University, Bristol, Rhode Island

In the northeastern Pacific, their larvae settle to the benthos in the Spring/Summer, often in high densities. Especially during years of strong recruitment, their consumption of available food may represent an important episodic disturbance to the nearshore and estuarine habitats in which they settle. Analyses of diet composition are central to resolving predator-prey interactions in food web investigations, but traditional methods to determine diet composition, such as *in situ* observation and gut content analyses, are difficult with small, cryptic and mobile species like juvenile crabs. Fatty acids (FA) are widely used as trophic markers in the investigation of marine food webs and are particularly useful for discriminating the diets of herbivores. Here we used a laboratory feeding experiment to assess whether the FA of juvenile Dungeness crabs show clear differences when reared on multiple mono-specific diets of putative wild food sources, including ‘meat’ (e.g., megalopae - cannibalism; rockfish; bivalves); and ‘algal’ diets (*Ulva sp.* and urchin feces derived from *Ulva* diets fed to urchins). We found that the FA of newly settled juvenile crabs in a 6-week feeding trial were strongly separated by the prey consumed. We identify several FA that were particularly good tracers for separating these diets.

A particular aspect that of increasing attention is the ecological relationship between sharks and coral reef health.  Removal of any type of predatory animal can greatly affect community structure. However, despite recent advances in our understanding these communities, evidence is often circumstantial on coral reefs because fishing pressure frequently varies with other anthropogenic effects, such changes in water quality and habitat due to land-based impacts, as well as tourism impacts.  We addressed this in Palau due to its robust reefs and protected populations of reef sharks.  We worked in concert with the Micronesian Shark Research Foundation, who has been collecting citizen science data since 2002. We surveyed a range of sites to gather data on reef shark abundance and species composition, mesopredator abundance, coral cover, and tourism activity (diving, fishing, boating, snorkel) in order to evaluate how these factors co-vary. Our data identified sites that appear to be nursery areas for grey sharks. We found the highest mesopredator abundance on reefs with low shark abundance, but no clear relationship between shark abundance and coral cover.  This initial study suggests that sharks likely do play an important role on the ecology of reefs, but that their impact may not extend to the corals themselves.

However, the early life history and the mechanisms controlling large interannual population variability of market squid are poorly understood. Variability in recruitment may be driven by the abundance of preferred prey species near paralarval hatching grounds during the critical feeding period of paralarvae. Although paralarvae have been reared on laboratory diets, the natural prey species of market squid paralarvae remain largely unknown. To determine which of the abundant potential prey species collected from natural plankton paralarvae ingest, paralarvae (15-30 days post-hatching) were exposed to single-species groups of potential prey and consumption rates were measured over 24 hours. Paralarvae successfully captured and consumed 12 prey species ranging in size from 150 µm to 1.5 mm. Paralarvae did not consume fish larvae or brachiolaria larvae during the 24hr consumption rate trials. The preference of paralarvae for specific prey items was then tested by exposing paralarvae to mixtures of multiple prey species and computing Ivlev’s Electivity Index values to rank preferred prey. Paralarvae demonstrated a preference for copepod nauplii over mature copepods and other prey species. 15-30 days after hatching, paralarvae are still learning prey capture behavior and seem to prefer prey items that demonstrate less complex escape behavior.",San Diego State University,,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Bocskor, K.M.",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,1,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Reefs on the East and West shores, however, do not show this trend. The reason for this disparity in reef health around the island is a troubling mystery, especially to the local people who are reliant on the reefs for survival. Due to the steep topography on the East and West shores of the island, most of the development and agriculture takes place in the North shore’s two valleys. These valleys form the watersheds for the two largest rivers on the island (Pao Pao and Opunohu). We hypothesize that the ecosystem state shift observed on the North shore is driven in part by elevated inputs of terrestrially-derived nutrients and sediment. Despite the extensive research conducted around Moorea on reef ecosystems, very little work has been done regarding the basic hydrology of rivers on Moorea, much less nutrient fluxes, sedimentation rates, and river plume dynamics. The project presented here is a multi-year collaboration between researchers and local stakeholders to deepen our understanding of freshwater systems on Moorea, and their role in shaping neighboring reef ecosystems.

Knowing which measurements are needed to estimate biomass will greatly increase the sampling efficiency of divers or researchers by allowing them to allocate more effort to increased sampling while maintaining precision. Non-destructive estimates of macroalgae biomass help to preserve the ecosystem but require precise length-weight models. In this study, length-weight relationships were established for *Saccharina latissima* (sugar wrack kelp) in the Southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada. Plants were harvested via SCUBA (n=73) to measure four metrics of blade size (± 1 cm), stipe length, blade length, total length, and blade width, as well as wet weight (± 10%). Next, fifteen linear models were developed for combinations of blade measurements as functions of wet weight. The r^2 values were compared to determine the model that best accounted for variability between the linear metrics and biomass. For *S. latissima*, the model describing wet weight as a function of total length was the simplest model that adequately accounted for variation (r^2 = 0.8602), although the model containing all four variables explained a higher proportion of the variance (r^2 = 0.8799).

We collected replicate tissue samples for seven weeks to monitor changes in the microbiome. Results show shifts over time, suggesting that the entire microbiome is influenced both by the heat stress and by changes in the photosymbiont status.

In the absence of this keystone predator, sea urchin grazing is intensified and rocky reefs are rapidly deforested, leading to widespread kelp forest collapse. The effects of this transformation are thought to be far reaching, with implications for trophically connected species across marine habitats. We propose to quantify changes in kelp forest food web structure through deep time by comparing the isotopic signature of dominant reef consumers before, during, and after sea otter extirpation. We will analyse the bone collagen from archaeological faunal remains of mammals and reef fish, to reconstruct prehistoric kelp forest food webs and infer the effects of kelp forest collapse on these consumers. We hypothesize greater trophic diversity existed in the presence of keystone predation by sea otters and abundant kelp forests and that differences in kelp carbon assimilation will be more pronounced in sessile compared to mobile species. Our work aims to clarify the extent of ecosystem-level effects of trophic downgrading and kelp forest collapse in the Northeastern Pacific and will further our understanding of historical baselines which can inform management strategies today.","School of Resource and Environmental Management, Simon Fraser University","School of Resource and Environmental Management, Simon Fraser University",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Earle, H.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Salomon, A.K.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

The Salish Sea provides an excellent system to investigate this dynamic, as the watersheds that feed into the Sea are patchworks of urban development, wildlands, and highly managed, regularly clear-cut forest. One of the primary habitat-forming species within the Salish Sea that is likely influenced by watershed development is bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana). Observations by resource managers have suggested long term declines in the extent of floating bull kelp canopies, which are highly sensitive to increased turbidity and sedimentation. However, classification of kelp extent using remote sensing is challenging due to dynamic patches, water reflectance of submerged kelp, heterogeneous pixels, and turbid water in some satellite imagery. We used multiple endmember spectral mixing analysis (MESMA), implemented for the first time in Google Earth Engine, to map kelp extent using Landsat 8 imagery. 
We will use this analysis to create a long-term time series of kelp extent in the Salish Sea to model major terrestrial contributors to mobile sediment, including clear-cut plots, and impervious surfaces. The watersheds that feed into the Salish Sea have experienced a loss of 6% of forested areas and 3% increase in urban areas from 2001 to 2011. Our findings highlight the role that anthropogenic disturbance, specifically watershed development, may play in long-term bull kelp dynamics within the Salish Sea.","University of California, Davis","University of California, Davis","University of California, Davis",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Tiedeman, K.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Hollarsmith, J.A.","Ghosh, A.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Microplastics are manufactured plastics (primary), or environmentally degraded plastics (secondary), that are smaller than 5.0 mm.  Microplastics are widespread aquatic pollutants that enter watersheds from human sources, such as packaging or cosmetics, and have been found to be ingested by marine organisms.  Surface water and sediment samples were collected at several locations along the Puget Sound and observed under a microscope for an initial visual analysis, which suggested plastics were present in the environment.  Littorina littorea were collected from Alki Beach to perform experiments on the possibility of microplastic ingestion, and if ingestion could lead to trait disruption.  Preliminary data analyzed how snail size and time kept in the laboratory affected the snails’ ability to recover from physical disturbance.  Further experimentation includes observing potential snail microplastic ingestion rates based on size, abundance, and types of plastics and exploring snail respiration rates and morphologies as indicators of trait distruption.

We compared attachment strength and mobility in *Leptasterias* spp. from microhabitats inferred to be more or less wave-impacted. Attachment strength, the force required to dislodge a star from its substrate, was quantified by a direct pulling test in the field and laboratory using a flexible, piano-wire clamp connected to a spring scale. Additionally, resistance to dislodgement by controlled water surge was measured in field and lab environments. And, righting time of sea stars placed oral side up (“flip time”) was recorded as a measure of mobility, in the field and lab. We analyzed results of these tests using Mann-Whitney U tests and showed that the attachment strength of *Leptasterias* spp. in more wave-impacted microhabitats is generally greater than in less wave-impacted microhabitats, whereas the mobility of more wave-impacted sea stars was lower than that of less wave-impacted sea stars. The difference in attachment strength and mobility of *Leptasterias* spp. may be a local adaptation to wave-stressed environments and this is being explored further using genetic methods.","EOS, San Francisco State University; UC Berkeley","EOS, San Francisco State University","EOS, San Francisco State University","EOS, San Francisco State University",,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Gong, Z.",,,,,NA,NA,"Jaffe, N.H.","Bland, R.","Cohen, C.S.",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

However, the roles that foundation species play in structuring communities include both direct (e.g., providing habitat) and indirect (e.g., modifying environmental factors) effects and occur within a complex web of species interactions. We studied *Odonthalia floccosa*, the dominant algal species in tide pools at our study site in southeastern Alaska, to determine how it may affect community diversity and abundance of associated species. We conducted community surveys in 36 tide pools over two seasons (summer and fall). Interestingly, we did not find evidence that *Odonthalia* increases diversity although it appears to facilitate individual species groups. Algal diversity and total (algal + invertebrate) diversity in the pools tended to decrease with increased *Odonthalia* abundance, suggesting that *Odonthalia* may be competing with other species for space or other resources. At the same time, the abundance of *Littorina* species (the most common mobile invertebrates) was directly and positively related to *Odonthalia* abundance, and *Littorina* abundance declined paralleling declines in *Odonthalia* between the summer and fall surveys.

First Nations reported coastwide declines in the quality and quantity of the traditionally harvested red alga, *Pyropia abbottiae*. It was suggested that the warm water anomaly (nicknamed 'The Blob') that circulated in the northeast Pacific in 2014-2015 may have caused P. abbottiae to miss environmental cues required to complete its life cycle. Although *P. abbottiae* has been studied in the lab in Alaska and Washington, less is known about its interaction with environmental cues in nature. Here, we use quantitative field surveys, recruitment plates, and environmental data collected from Calvert Island, Central B.C., and controlled physiological studies in the lab to determine environmental drivers of phenology and vertical distribution. Preliminary in situ results demonstrate that seasonal trends in gametophyte and sporophyte phenology are strongly related to environmental factors (temperature and nutrients). Both factors are being tested in laboratory studies examining *P. abbottiae* growth and life cycle under varying temperature (10 °C and 16 °C) and nitrate concentrations (0 µM, 5 µM, 25 µM, 50 µM, f/2).

As reefs shift from coral to macroalgae, mechanisms that control benthic community structure are of increasing importance for coral reef resilience. Herbivorous fishes facilitate coral-dominated reefs through top-down (algal consumption) and bottom-up (nutrient supply) pathways. Current research that focuses on top-down forces suggests that herbivores partition resources via inter- and intraspecific foraging. We are investigating the relationship between body size and intraspecific variation in herbivory (consumption) and nutrient supply (excretion and egestion). We collected empirical data on consumption rates, diet selectivity, excretion and egestion rates in one of the most abundant parrotfish in Moorea, French Polynesia. Small parrotfish (< 15 cm) predominantly consume epibionts and turf algae, while large individuals (>15 cm) excavate endolithic algae and consume several types of macroalgae. Ontogenetic shifts in diet, from a consistent high protein diet required for somatic growth to a more generalist diet, are reflected in mass-specific excretion rates and nutrient ratios (N:P). We will be using these field-based empirical data to inform physiological bioenergetics models that allow us to scale processes to herbivore populations to understand how changes in size structure affect ecosystem-scale nutrient dynamics.","University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Ecology Evolution and Marine Biology","University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Ecology Evolution and Marine Biology","University of Michigan, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Munsterman, K.S.",,,,,NA,NA,"Burkepile, D.B.","Allgeier, J.E.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

In temperate coastal ecosystems, where kelp forests and seagrass meadows are abundant, kelp subsidies can be incorporated into seagrass food webs by consumers. These kelp subsidies may disrupt classic grazer-epiphyte interactions, where top-down control by grazing invertebrates generally regulates epiphyte production. We tested this potential de-coupling via kelp subsidies in a sub-tidal, outer coast seagrass meadow in British Columbia, Canada. First, we examined seagrass meadow grazer - epiphyte biomass relationships using collections made by SCUBA. Potential bottom-up factors driving these relationships were considered by examining the palatability (C:N ratios) of in-situ seagrass production (*Zostera marina*, *Ulva lactuca*, and *Smithora naiadum*) relative to kelp forest subsidies (*Nereocystis luetkeana*). Using the seagrass isopod, *Idotea resecata*, we further examined trophic transfer of seagrass and kelp biomass using Bayesian isotopic mixing models (?^15^N and ?^13^C) from field collections. We found that *N. luetkeana* had similarly high palatability as the seagrass epiphyte *S. naiadum* and *U. lactuca*. Yet, our preliminary results show - experimentally and observationally - a preference for *N. luetkeana* kelp subsidies in seagrass meadow grazers.

Nearshore rockfish populations are modelled by stock assessments that are often informed by only fisheries-dependent data, and many are categorized as data moderate or remain data poor. Incorporating fisheries-independent data increases data availability and provides the assessment model with information not reliant on angler behavior. Cal Poly has collected fisheries-dependent rockfish data from Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFVs) since 2003 and fisheries-independent rockfish data through the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP), which samples areas shallower than CPFVs, since 2007. CCFRP data could be used as a source of fisheries-independent data in stock assessments. We are interested in understanding how patterns in the CCFRP data relate to the fisheries-independent data already used in stock assessments. Previous studies and preliminary examinations of these data show that habitat and fishing closure affect length distribution and overall catch, two key factors used in assessing rockfish populations. I am developing a series of models that integrate fisheries-independent CCFRP data and fisheries-dependent CPFV data to determine the relative predictive power of environment and fishing closure for five rockfish species.

The rise of P. hiltoni at Duxbury Reef (37° 53’ 23” N, 122° 41’ 59” W) in Marin County coincided with a decline in several resident nudibranch species, potentially from P. hiltoni consuming these species and increasing competition for hydroid prey. To determine if vulnerable nudibranchs of Duxbury Reef are still in decline or whether the reef is recovering from the disturbance of P. hiltoni, I have conducted monthly to bimonthly timed counts from January 2018 to present. There was an overall decrease in abundance of nudibranchs at Duxbury Reef. However, Phidiana hiltoni has continued to increase in abundance and is the most abundant nudibranch on the reef. Few species considered vulnerable to P. hiltoni like Doto amyra have increased in abundance while several vulnerable species like Hermissenda spp., the most abundant species prior to the arrival of P. hiltoni, have declined. Using pictures harvested from iNaturalist and social media to map where P. hiltoni had been sighted in El Nino and La Nina years, I found that the range of P. hiltoni shifts south during El Nino and north during La Nina. Future efforts will aim to quantify hydroid feeding competence between P. hiltoni and resident slugs and to characterize interactions between P. hiltoni, Hermissenda crassicornis, and H. opalescens.","California Academy of Sciences

Therefore, it is important to characterize spatiotemporal variation in life history traits of harvested species to better understand their biological limitations and develop management plans to maximize fishery sustainability. In this study, we worked collaboratively with volunteer anglers to collect Canary Rockfish (*Sebastes pinniger*) – an economically and ecologically important groundfish – throughout their contiguous U.S. west coast range during the years 2017-2018 (N=1500). We used morphometric and maturity data to evaluate regional differences in Canary Rockfish size structure and size at 50% maturity. Our preliminary results indicate a significant latitudinal cline in total length (mm) and size at 50% maturity, where Canary Rockfish in northern regions grow larger and mature at larger sizes than Canary Rockfish in southern regions. Comparing sexes, males were found to mature at larger sizes for all regions except Oregon. Additional analyses of growth, age structure, condition, and mortality from otolith analysis will help to refine our understanding of latitudinal variation in life history and demographic traits.

STS compiles sighting data on a global scale, complementing national sea turtle citizen science initiatives, such as the NOAA sea turtle hotline (swfsc.turtle-sightings@noaa.gov) managed by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center. Upwell’s outreach, currently focusing on five of the world’s seven sea turtle species, began in the eastern Pacific and recently expanded to the western Pacific. Sea turtles rely on various marine habitats at different life cycle phases. While nesting beach protection has significantly improved, many sea turtle populations remain critically endangered levels due to pernicious at-sea threats. Telemetry, capture-recapture methods and stable isotope analysis can contribute a wealth of information on habitat use, yet time and funding shortages limit wider application. Combining citizen science data with the aforementioned research techniques can yield valuable data at decreased cost while improving conservation awareness. Upwell encourages sailboaters, surfers, sportfishers, SCUBA divers, snorkelers, artisanal fishers, kayakers and other ocean enthusiasts to register incidental sightings of sea turtles at sea. STS provides a user-friendly, accessible platform to aggregate additional data needed to characterize habitat, predict patterns of usage, and prioritize conservation actions to reduce at-sea threats to marine turtles.",Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas (CICIMAR),Upwell,Central Washington University,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Rousso, S.

BETWEEN MICROHABITATS,"*Leptasterias* is a genus of small, predatory sea stars that brood their young, causing limited dispersal and potential for local adaptation. We examined foraging activity and mobility in Leptasterias by collecting samples from inferred protected and wave-impacted intertidal sites to determine whether prey preference differed between these two microhabitats. Stars from Pescadero, California (n=26) and Trinidad, California (n=21) were used in binary prey choice assays and righting response tests. Prey treatments consisted of mussels, barnacles, and snails to reflect the difference in prey abundance within each microhabitat. Treatments were presented on opposite ends of a 38 liter tank, with either two different prey items at opposite ends or a prey item vs a no-prey control. Star positions were recorded at 5 minute intervals for 1 hour. Preference was measured by calculating the star distance relative to each choice throughout the trial. Resulting distances were averaged and compared between microhabitats. Righting responses were measured as the time taken for a star to right itself from its aboral side. Results show *Leptasterias* prey preference did not differ significantly between microhabitats, indicating that these stars may engage in generalist foraging behaviors. Our results are compatible with some prior hypotheses, however previous lab studies have suggested that *Leptasterias* may display prey preference. We suggest further work with alternative tank designs, larger sample sizes, and the incorporation of potential clade differences.","University of Portland and Estuary and Ocean Science Center, San Francisco State University","Estuary and Ocean Science Center, San Francisco State University","Estuary and Ocean Science Center, San Francisco State University",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Shough, A.E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Johnson, M.W.","Cohen, C.S.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

However, the significance of this to population dynamics is unknown, and raises management questions during species removal efforts. *Botrylloides diegensis*, a botryllid capable of WBR, has an enigmatic distribution due to taxonomic confusion. In this species in central California, we focus on environmental components affecting minute fragments before WBR occurs, particularly temperature and salinity. Six colonies were collected and clonal replicates were established to allow comparison of viability and mortality in field (16-19 °C; 28-31 salinity) and lab settings (14 °C; 33 salinity). Each genotype was subjected to four vascular ablation treatments, isolating 1-4 ampullae. Daily micro-photography was used to track signs of WBR and mortality. Field replicates were lost across all four treatments more rapidly than those in the lab; observations suggest field replicates experienced more predation and spatial competition with invertebrate settlers. Overall, we found these small clusters of ampullae were insufficient for WBR during late summer. Thus, we suggest fragments of a few ampullae may not be important to the demography of these colonial ascidians. And, leaving remnants of < 5 ampullae may not pose a reasonable threat in management of invasive botryllids. Ongoing genetic analysis will assist conservation in defining the distribution and native region of *B. diegensis*.","Estuary and Ocean Science Center; Biology Department, San Francisco State University","Estuary and Ocean Science Center; Biology Department, San Francisco State University","Estuary and Ocean Science Center; Biology Department, San Francisco State University",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Hernandez, C.",,,,,NA,NA,"Punak, N.A.","Cohen, C.S.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

The study was conducted over a period of four months at two different locations from the mouth of the harbor: one 0.4 miles away and the second 0.67 miles away. Each location had two ceramic plates placed underwater to allow the growth marine fouling communities. Every two weeks, observation for succession of the *Crassostrea gigas* and the *Mytilus californianus* was recorded, while environmental parameters were taken. Average quantity per five feet was also measured among the docks at both locations. From the environmental data, the only significant difference found was that site one has a lower salinity of 33% then site two with 35%. It was found that after three months, the settlement of *Mytilus* presented itself first, while *Crassostrea* at four months still have not settled. Site 1 recorded 13 mussels that settled on the ceramic plates, while site 2 only had one. Further more, it was found that about every five feet, there was one Pacific Oyster.

In this region, *A. elegantissima* only hosts the dinoflagellate *Symbiodinium muscatinei*. The San Francisco Bay outflow creates a tidally-influenced low-salinity plume that impacts adjacent coastal sites.  Salinity, temperature, and aerial stress may induce a bleaching response similar to corals where symbionts are expelled, causing further energetic stress. Using field observations of environmental conditions and symbiont abundance, along with fully crossed multifactorial lab experiments, we tested for changes in symbiont abundance in response to stressors. Five-day lab experiments were designed to mimic short term outflow events with low salinity, high temperature, and aerial exposure treatments. Results showed high variability in the responses of the 10 anemones per treatment, suggesting greater sample sizes for future studies. Symbiont density increased in anemones in lab treatments that did not include aerial exposure. Field observations show a difference in symbiont density in tidepools across tidal heights, suggesting that aerial exposure may affect symbiont density more than sea surface temperature and salinity at our sites. This symbiosis may be useful for examining effects of outflow events and predicted changes in ocean conditions on temperate tidepool communities.","Department of Biology, Estuary and Ocean Science Center at San Francisco State University","Department of Biology, Estuary and Ocean Science Center at San Francisco State University",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Hossfeld, D.H.",,,,,NA,NA,"Cohen, C.S.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Questions remain as to precisely how individual fish are utilizing microhabitats within the kelp forest complex.  We are conducting weekly SCUBA surveys to record associations between the adjacent microhabitats of *S. atrovirens* and other fishes in the vicinity.  Data on fish total length, microhabitat, and behavior are collected via underwater visual census (UVC) as well as extracted from diver operated stereoscopic video (DOV).  Observations to-date suggest considerable daily variation in *S. atrovirens* abundance and significant differences between microhabitat associations, with 81% hovering in kelp, 8% hovering midwater, 9% resting on substrata, and 2% resting in crevices.  Our data suggest individuals are limited to the kelp stipes until reaching adult sizes, when they can then occupy other microhabitats.  Moving forward, events such as schooling and body orientation within the water column will be addressed through imagery, while UVC data will provide us with data on abundance.  We plan to collect imagery over the course of a year, and expect microhabitat associations to shift over time.  A greater understanding of where *S. atrovirens* are and why will lead to more informed management of California’s kelp forest communities.","Institute for Applied Marine Ecology, California State University, Monterey Bay, Seaside, California, 93955","Institute for Applied Marine Ecology, California State University, Monterey Bay, Seaside, California, 93955",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Strickland, K.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Lindholm, J.B.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Published literature suggests that juvenile fishes (e.g., rockfishes of the genus *Sebastes*) use the kelp canopy as refuge near the surface and in the water column. Less is known about the utilization of drift kelp accumulated on the seafloor by juvenile rockfishes. This study aims to evaluate the extent to which drift kelp accumulating on the sand immediately adjacent to the kelp forest at Monastery Beach (southern Carmel Bay) contributes to the halo of suitable habitat for juvenile rockfishes beyond the reef-sand interface and the extent to which these fish utilize that additional habitat.  Microhabitat utilization of temperate reef fishes is documented through transects on SCUBA extending out five meters from the reef-sand interface and 12-18 meters in depth; data are collected through underwater visual census (UVC) recorded imagery from diver-operated stereo video (DOV). Preliminary results show 74.4% of observed juvenile rockfish are utilizing drift kelp at an average of 9.92 meters from the kelp forest boundary while the remaining rockfishes are found at an average of 2.4 meters or less when utilizing other microhabitats.

The mechanisms by which gulls coexist in the San Juan Islands of Washington state are poorly studied, although, there is evidence of niche partitioning in gulls of northeastern North America and northwestern Europe. To investigate their coexistence on San Juan Island, WA, we studied the intertidal feeding ecology of Mew Gulls (*Larus canus*), California Gulls (*L. californicus*) and Glaucous-winged Gulls (*L. glaucescens*). Patterns in abundance, behavior, substratum-use, and large prey type (identifiable through spotting scope) were investigated through observational methods at Jackson Beach. The species did not differ in behavioral time allocation and substratum use while foraging. However, there were significant differences in relative frequency mean rank of both worm and fish capture among the three species. Patterns in mean large prey capture per individual and instances of large prey capture suggest that California Gulls and Mew Gulls specialize in capturing fish and worms, respectively. These findings indicate that during foraging, the gull species allocate their time and substratum-use similarly, but use shared habitat differently by specializing in different large prey types.

Ocean acidification and warming sea surface temperatures are the results of the oceans absorbing the excess carbon dioxide and heat from the atmosphere, due primarily to the increased burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. These changes in water conditions may have a variety of detrimental impacts on marine organisms. Cephalopods may be particularly sensitive to changes in environmental pH due to their use of hemocyanin as an oxygen transport pigment, which has strong Bohr and Root effects. Thus, the affinity and carrying capacity of hemocyanin for O~2~ is decreased in a low pH environment. In addition, sensitivity to pH is increased in warmer temperatures. We constructed energy budgets for *Octopus rubescens* exposed to high pCO~2~ and high temperature treatments, both separately and combined. Energy budgets were calculated based on metabolic rates, consumption, and growth. We also measured the critical oxygen pressures of each octopus after five weeks of treatment because of the possibility of reduced oxygen transport in these conditions. Our results suggest that energy budgeting is altered in response to expected climate change conditions, with more energy allotted to respiration than when in control or single treatment conditions. Additionally, the critical oxygen pressure is significantly increased when exposed to higher pCO~2~, suggesting that *O. rubescens* may have a reduced habitat range due to decreased hypoxia tolerance.",Walla Walla University,Walla Walla University,Washington State University,Walla Walla University,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Culler, M.E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Evans, L.A.","Jacobs, K.P.","Onthank, K.L.",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

A major challenge in these studies is building robust assemblies in the absence of a complete, well annotated genome. New sequencing methods, such as Expressed Exome Capture (EecSeq), present unique challenges and opportunities.  EecSeq has the potential to be applied to any organisms, if exon loci can be efficiently assembled directly from capture reads. We sought to test a de novo assembly and assessment pipeline for EecSeq studies using sample reads from the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) to build an exome assembly. We chose four transcriptome assembly programs (Oases, rnaSPAdes, Trans-ABySS, and Trinity) and one genome assembly program (SPAdes) to build the oyster exomes. To categorize these different assemblies, we compared number of transcripts generated, N50 values, annotation rates, and BUSCO values. We found that no one assembly outperformed the other in every assessment. The Oases assembly had the highest N50 values (2147 bp) and Annotation rates (169,198 genes); while Trans-ABySS assembly contig number was closest to the predicted number of oyster genes (555,531 contigs). The merged DeDupe assembly was able to capture the highest number of complete BUSCO values (339 complete) with the lowest rates of fragmentation (374 fragment), but also had the highest missing rate (265 missing). In this study we show that EecSeq provides a cost and time effective solution for building de novo exome assemblies.","Department of Biological Sciences, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA","Department of Biological Sciences, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Green, J.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Puritz, J.B.",,,,,,,,2,No,N/A,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

GEOGRAPHIC VARIABILITY OF IMPACTS TO BULL KELP CANOPY AREA IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SINCE 2014,"Bull kelp (*Nereocystis luetkeana*) is a predominant primary producer on the northern coast of California, which has been severely impacted since 2014 by a series of ecological and environmental stressors.  These events have led to a dramatic broad-scale decline in bull kelp canopy north of San Francisco, leading to widespread starvation conditions linked to the collapse of the recreational red abalone fishery. The purpose of this study was to assess the extent and trajectory of changes to the bull kelp canopy by county (San Mateo to Humboldt counties) to determine the geographic variability of impact.  Aerial kelp survey data (California Department of Fish and Wildlife: 1999-2016) was used to compare the total canopy area post-impact (2014, 2015, and 2016) to the maximum historical extent (1999-2012) by county.  Sonoma and Mendocino counties historically accounted for 94.53% of the total maximum canopy area, supporting 39.08 km2 of nearly contiguous bull kelp forests.  Kelp forests in San Mateo, Marin, and Humboldt counties were less abundant, and patchy due to dominant soft-bottom habitats and freshwater influence.  After 2014, the Sonoma and Mendocino county kelp canopy declined by more than 90% and Humboldt and Marin by more than 50%, while canopy in the other counties either remained at historic levels (Del Norte and San Francisco) or increased (San Mateo).  These results provide insights on the dynamics of this crucial primary producer in a rapidly changing climate, and will stimulate further research to test the potential mechanisms underlying these dynamics.","California Polytechnic State University

Southern California abalone populations exist in low density aggregations, potentially impacting fertilization success. Synchronized spawning and conspecific sperm chemotaxis are mechanisms known to increase fertilization success. Another mechanism may be an observed but unquantified contraction behavior while spawning. I am examining the effects of contractions on gamete dispersal and fertilization success in the red abalone, *Haliotis rufescens*. I hypothesize that the height of projected gamete plumes will increase with increasing contractile forces. I am measuring the force of red abalone spawning contractions using a force transducer, capturing the resultant gamete plumes with high-speed frames, and measuring the parameters of the plumes on Kinovea. I further hypothesize that gamete dispersal distances and fertilization success will increase when gametes originate from larger contractions relative to smaller contractions or slow discharges. Using passive plankton traps *in situ*, I will quantify the dispersal distance of eggs released with small versus large contractions. I will calculate the percent of fertilization of eggs deployed in mesh bags *in situ* along a transect array at progressive distances from a gamete release point where sperm will be released by contractions versus slow discharges.

Sea star densities have fluctuated dramatically over the past 40+ years, but appear to be decoupled from local factors such as annual upwelling intensity or cumulative hours exposed during low tide. Instead, sea star population abundances and recruitment were significantly correlated with multiple regional climate indices that include the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). In the late 1970s, this species was severely impacted by a densovirus-associated wasting disease, first observed several years prior to the extreme 1982-1983 El Niño event; PVP populations did not recover to earlier densities until the late 1980s. A similar die-off was recorded in 2013, again preceding the 2015-2016 record-setting El Niño event by several years. Based on our previous observations, we predict that it will take approximately a decade for PVP sea stars to recover from the latest mass mortality event.","California State University, Long Beach, CA 90840","Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, San Pedro, CA, 92866","Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, San Pedro, CA, 92866","California State University, Long Beach, CA 90840",,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Allen, B.J.",,,,,NA,NA,"Passarelli, J.K","Lawrenz-Miller, S.E.","Miller, A.C.",,,,,,4,Yes,N/A,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

During the years of 2014 and 2015, the largest recorded marine heatwave threatened this ecosystem, leading to wide-spread kelp loss and massive recruitment of purple urchins (*Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*). While temperatures have returned to average, grazing by the large urchin population is keeping kelp at record low abundances. Currently, there is limited knowledge regarding bulk kelp resistance to environmental change during its microscopic early life stages, notably temperature and pH changes. In this study, we exposed *N. luetkeana* early life stages to low and high temperature (10? and 15?C) pH (7.8 and 7.5) conditions in a fully factorial laboratory experiment. We then exposed the embryonic sporophytes to urchin grazing to observe grazing efficiency at early life stages. Our findings show that bull kelp early life stages, when given sufficient nutrients, can survive high temperature conditions and mature faster in high temperatures compared to low temperatures. We observed highest egg production per female in low-pH low-temperature conditions, but no pH effect at the sporophyte stage. We found that grazing led to fewer sporophytes, despite their small size, and greater coverage of diatoms. These results will aid researchers and managers in understanding the recovery potential of Northern California bull kelp forests in occasion of future warm water events and high urchin grazing pressure.","University of California, Davis",Bodega Marine Laboratory,"University of California, Davis","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis",,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Oceguera Zavala, J.O.",,,,,NA,NA,"Winquist,T.","Grosholz, E.

In Monterey Bay, urchin populations have been increasing, leading to overgrazing of kelp beds and a rise in patches of urchin barrens. To understand the increase of urchins in Monterey Bay, we have created a Central Coast network to monitor sea urchin settlement patterns. Our monitoring and sampling design are based on the methods employed by Schroeter et al. at the Santa Barbara Long Term Ecological Research project. We sampled urchin recruits by hanging two lines fitted with four scrub brush recruitment collectors, from four piers in the Central Coast area: Santa Cruz, Capitola, Monterey, and Pebble Beach. We swap brushes at each site weekly, process them by rinsing each brush in seawater, and filter the contents through a 300-micron mesh. Samples are preserved in vials filled with EtOH, and sorted under a dissecting microscope to count the number of urchin recruits. Monterey Bay is an important site, because of the diverse marine ecosystem that relies on kelp forests. Understanding spatial and temporal recruitment patterns within Monterey Bay, will help us make predictions about future kelp forest ecosystems.","School of Natural Sciences, CSU Monterey Bay","Department of Ecology Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz","Department of Ecology Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz","Department of Ecology Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz","School of Natural Sciences, CSU Monterey Bay",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Pureco, D.",,,,,NA,NA,"Smith, J.G.","Sheridan, C.","Carr, M.H.","Haupt, A.J.",,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,
"Ramo, Hunter",ramo@usc.edu,2018-10-08 1:29,Evaluating the effects of predation risk on sex ratio in a temperate reef fish,"Hermaphroditic animals have evolved reproductive strategies to optimize sex ratios to maximize fitness in nature. Some fishes utilize sex change in high-risk environments to decrease conspicuousness during reproductive events. The extent to which sex change may mitigate changes in sex ratio due to predation risk, however, is not well understood. The bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli) is a simultaneously hermaphroditic fish found throughout the coastal waters of Southern California and northern Mexico that is known to exhibit predator avoidance behaviors (i.e., reduced foraging and increased refuge use), which could affect energy acquisition and prevalence of sex change. Using similar initial populations of bluebanded gobies (i.e., same ratio of males and females) we aimed to identify how predatory risk cues may impact adult sex ratios. We conducted a caging study on standardized rocky reefs to manipulate the level of risk perceived by gobies (low, medium, high) over month-long trials. We found no difference among risk treatments in sex ratio of gobies collected at the end of the trials, even though gobies in high-risk environments foraged less and spent a greater proportion of their time hiding. Our results suggest that sex change does not improve fitness in response to risk, at least not in bluebanded gobies. Further experimentation on the mechanisms involved with predator avoidance in sex-changing fishes is needed to understand the fitness benefits of hermaphroditism in high-risk environments.",University of Southern California,"California State University, Northridge","California State University, Northridge",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Ramo, H.J.",,,,,NA,NA,"Jarvis, G.C.","Steele, M.A",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Host-parasite relationships play an important role in shaping intertidal communities. One noteworthy example is the mussel-endolith system whereby endolithic cyanobacteria establish on, and erode, the calcium carbonate shells of shellfish. Studying how these endoliths impact host performance under a variety of temperatures may help us identify how this relationship may change with warming. Using a mesocosm system, we tested a variety of responses (growth, fitness metrics, erosion rates) of parasitized mussels (*Mytilus californianus*) collected from Calvert Island, BC, at four different temperatures (12°C, 15°C, 19°C and 22°C) over an eight-week period. We found that optimal shell growth in mussels occurs at approximately 45-50 millimetres in length. Furthermore, we found that wet tissue mass per unit length was highest under the 15°C treatment, while the greatest rate of erosion was found at 19°C, which may indicate a mismatch in the thermal optima of the host and parasite. We also found that the mussel’s ability to overcome erosion and continue to grow may be temperature dependent. These results can provide valuable insight into an understudied and highly prolific host-parasite system, and expand our understanding of how these important relationships may be affected by ocean warming.",University of British Columbia,University of British Columbia,University of British Columbia,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Brownlee, G.R.P",,,,,NA,NA,"Beaty, F.","Gehman, A.","Harley, C.D.G.",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,N/A,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Daily tidal cycles result in predictable, severe fluctuations in abiotic factors (e.g., temperature, oxygen, salinity, pH). The magnitude of environmental stress, differs between intertidal zones, with the most extreme physiological stress experienced by high intertidal organisms. We therefore hypothesize that sessile conspecifics from different intertidal positions (low, mid, high) will have distinct ‘metabolic phenotypes’ (i.e., baseline metabolic capacity and performance). To investigate this, we collected common acorn barnacles, *Balanus glandula*, from low, mid and high intertidal zones in San Luis Obispo Bay, CA and measured a suite of biochemical (lactate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activity), physiological (O~2~ consumption rates, body size), and behavioral (cirri beat frequency, time operculum open) measurements to characterize distinct intertidal position-driven metabolic phenotypes. Preliminary data revealed that high intertidal barnacles reach larger body sizes and have greater size-corrected oxygen consumption rates than those in the mid or low intertidal. Further, high intertidal barnacles have lower cirri beat frequencies and tend to remain open longer than barnacles in the mid and low zones. (Biochemical enzyme assays are currently underway.) These initial data support the idea of distinct metabolic phenotypes across the intertidal, and may suggest that *B. glandula* from different tidal positions have variable capacities to accommodate environmental change",California Polytechnic State University,California Polytechnic State University,California Polytechnic State University,California Polytechnic State University,Sonoma State University,,,,,NA,NA,California Polytechnic State University,,,,"Horn, KM",,,,,NA,NA,"Liautaud, KA","Conrad, CL","Telander, KJ","Zippay, ML","Hardy, KM",,,,6,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

When food limited, urchins reallocate resources to lengthen their feeding mechanism (Aristotle’s Lantern) to increase their grazing efficiency. We conducted a study to determine if variation in the lantern morphology of the purple sea urchin, *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*, is associated with macroalgae availability between urchin barrens and kelp forest habitats along the southern end of Monterey Bay, California. We used an index of proportion of lantern width-to-height against test width-to-height to compare the lantern morphology of urchins between locations as a function of habitat type (e.g. urchin barrens, forests). Sea urchins were found to have significantly different lantern indices between areas of high (i.e. macroalgae dominated) and low (i.e. coralline dominated) food availability (p-value=0.0251, DF=2). Lantern height and width was found to increase independent of urchin test diameter, and there was a significant overall inverse relationship between the Lantern Index and sea urchin condition, which was measured by a Gonad Index (p-value<0.0001). Studying the relationship between lantern variation and food availability between different habitat types enables ecologists to better understand how urchins respond to and might impact their ecosystem when faced by food fluctuations and shortages.","University of California, Santa Cruz","University of California, Santa Cruz","University of California, Santa Cruz",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Garcia, S.R.",,,,,NA,NA,"Smith, J.G.","Carr, M.H.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Specifically, reef-building corals may exhibit plasticity in growth structure and pattern, which may influence their performance and success in changing oceans as a result of global climate change. To investigate how coral growth (pattern and complexity) shift when exposed to a change in the environment, a transplant experiment took place in the Gates Lab at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in Kaneohe Bay, in which the growth of corals was monitored over a six-month period. During this transplant experiment, corals were reciprocally moved between two reef sites (inner and outer bay reefs) that differ in physical conditions. Paired genotype samples of two species of corals (n=40 *Montipora capitata*, n=40 *Porites compressa*) were stained with a skeletal marker (Alizarin Red S). Directionality of growth, complexity, and linear extension were calculated and compared between genotype and environments. We examined whether growth patterns are more strongly influenced by genotype or environment and whether individuals shift growth patterns in response to the transplant. Measuring directionality of individual coral growth provides a unique perspective on reef ecosystem complexity, which is important for habitat availability for other organisms. It is important to understand the growth patterns of corals in response to a change in the environment and how coral reefs rebuild following disturbances.",Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology,Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology,Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Epps, A.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Huffmyer, A.S.","Gates, R.D.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am an undergraduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Most work on mussel growth and shell deposition has focused on the independent and synergistic effects of food and the abiotic environment (temperature, wave exposure, pH), with relatively little work on the effects of predators. On moderately wave-protected shores of northern California, molluscivorous rock crabs *Romaleon antennarium* are abundant throughout the intertidal zone and could represent a strong selective force on mussel growth and shell deposition. To address this, we combined preference assays and field transplants to determine whether crabs represent an important predation risk to mussels. We found that rock crabs readily prefer mussels over other common molluscan prey in the lab and voraciously consume mussels transplanted low on the shore. We also combined field surveys of mussel morphometrics and crab attack rates on mussel replicas with a common-garden laboratory experiment to examine associations between crab predation risk and mussel growth and shell deposition. We found that mussel size, shell thickness growth rates were all tightly linked with predation risk from crabs; with mussels from high risk locations growing faster and producing thicker shells than mussels from low risk locations.

This study evaluated the effects of high temperature during low-tide on gene-expression of heat-shock protein, HSP-70.  For our first experiment, we placed mussels in three beakers that simulated three different physiological conditions (aerobic cold-17°C, anaerobic cold-17°C, and anaerobic hot-23°C) for 6 hours.  After 6 hours, we dissected all mussels and analyzed the gill tissue.  Our second experiment tracked gene-expression temporally through a low-tide heating event.  Results revealed a robust elevation in the level of HSP-70 mRNA expressed in the anaerobic hot mussels when compared to the aerobic and anaerobic controls.  In addition, results from the temporal experiment showed that the level of HSP-70 mRNA was highest when the mussels were out of the water and fell once the mussels were reintroduced to the tank.  These results suggest that the mussel genome is finely tuned to the fluctuating intertidal environment.

We discovered a small (20 ha) bed of rhodoliths in Kinzarof Lagoon, an embayment of Cold Bay, near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula.   The rhodolith bed occurred in a shallow tidal channel at -1 to -2 m water depth (mean lower low water).

However, these surveys are based almost exclusively on a few groups of large, conspicuous species like corals and fish because the majority of marine species are extremely small, difficult to identify using traditional approaches, and/or undescribed. We therefore sought to take advantage of recent advances in DNA sequencing to test if the same patterns are found in the far more diverse small organisms that have been largely ignored to date. We used high-throughput DNA sequencing of taxonomically informative gene regions (metabarcoding) in a spatially-structured study design to describe patterns of biodiversity of organisms < 2mm from four tropical marine ecosystems (seagrass beds, *Agaricia tenuifolia* coral reefs, mangroves, and sediments) in the tropical lagoon of Bocas del Toro, Panama. To our surprise, sediments—rather than coral reefs—contained both the greatest number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs; computationally produced approximations of biological species) and the highest proportion of OTUs unable to be identified using public databases. Additionally, the regional OTU pool of mangrove root epibionts was comparable to that of coral reefs, suggesting mangrove roots may also host more biodiversity than was previously thought.

This initial recruitment was associated in time with increased water temperature associated with the NE Pacific “blob” and the beginning of the 2015-2016 ENSO event. Pacific oysters are now common at many locations in Carr Inlet. This change in community structure was detected by a citizen-science beach monitoring program initiated in 2013 at rocky sites in Carr Inlet and the Gig Harbor area. As part of this program, data on oyster density and size were collected at sites where oysters are common. After initial establishment at a site, densities tended to decline due to mortality, while median size of oysters continued to increase due to growth of remaining individuals. At all sites, the median size has continued to increase through summer 2018, indicating that the populations have not yet reached a stable size structure. Size frequency distributions changed over time showing both this growth of individuals over time and the recruitment of new oysters into the population for the last three years. This recruitment, while variable across sites, has continued in spite of cooler water temperatures during late 2016-2018. Continued recruitment may lead to persistence of these novel populations of the introduced Pacific oyster on South Puget Sound beaches.

Rapid population assessments of some marine burrowing decapods have been possible by counting burrow openings to estimate abundance; however, these decapods are not ubiquitous to environments requiring monitoring. Additionally, the presence of other burrowing macrofauna may reduce the efficacy of burrow openings in estimating macrofauna abundance. As such, we assessed mudflats along the north coast of British Columbia, Canada to determine if macrofauna abundances could be estimated from burrow openings on the sediment surface in regions of low and high biodiversity. Abundance was successfully estimated at low diversity sites where only one macrofaunal species created burrows. At the high diversity site, multiple species grouped together in the statistical analysis, resulting in predictive models estimating total macrofaunal abundance. We recommend these considerations for burrow opening counts as a rapid, non-invasive population assessment technique: (1) burrow opening counts to estimate species abundance works better at sites with low macrofaunal diversity than high macrofaunal diversity (2) at high macrofaunal diverse sites, burrow opening counts may be more appropriate for predicting total macrofaunal population abundance than individual species abundance (3) relationships between burrow openings counts and macrofaunal abundance must be empirically tested in any system of interest.",University of Victoria,University of Northern British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,University of Northern British Columbia,University of Reading,University of Victoria,,,,NA,NA,Hidden River Environmental Management,Hidden River Environmental Management,Hidden River Environmental Management,University of Victoria,"Campbell, L.N.","Gerwing, T.G.",,,,NA,NA,"Wood, L.","Allen Gerwing, A.M.","Allen, S.","Sizmur, T.","Rogers, M.","Gray, O.","Drewes, M.","Juanes, F.",10,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Organismal/Population Biology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

It is a tidal system with large remnant wetlands, access to freshwater flows from the Yolo Bypass and Sacramento River, and elevations that are conductive to tidal restoration. The interaction of flows, tidal energy, and landscape geomorphology, combined with the availability of food, is likely responsible for the high diversity and abundance of native species in the region. Ongoing spatial and temporal comparisons of habitat and community assemblages can benefit restoration planning by providing information on potential habitat characteristics that promote native populations. The UC Davis Arc Project has performed monthly sampling in the Cache-Lindsay Slough complex of the North Delta since 2012 with the aim of providing baseline data and technical expertise to support restoration and increase native fish populations. We examined otter trawl data collected by the Arc Project from 2013 to 2016 to compare fish populations in the Cache and Lindsay slough complexes to investigate if noted habitat differences are driving differences in fish community assemblage. We found that the Cache slough complex seemed to support relatively higher native and non-native fish abundances, potentially due to higher productivity and preferential geomorphology of the Cache slough complex.","California State University, Northridge

The objective of the ongoing study is to describe measures of eelgrass abundance among beds throughout Humboldt Bay, California in order to understand the spatial variability of this CO~2~ draw-down potential. Nine beds, most of which are sampled with high, mid and low intertidal transects, and which represent oceanic to slough environments, were assessed in the early summers of 2017 and 2018. Randomly placed quadrats are used to describe the % cover of eelgrass and seaweeds as well as eelgrass shoot lengths, shoot densities and flowering. The above ground dry weight and Leaf Area Index (LAI) of eelgrass are estimated from shoot length. Cover and shoot density values for beds located in southern Humboldt Bay and close to the ocean connection appear to be much higher than for beds located in more lagoon type conditions. An analysis of all eelgrass abundance measures will be presented, but even a qualitative inspection of the data indicates that large spatial differences in draw-down potential exist. Separate studies, not included in this poster, are addressing the downward adjustment of LAI that will likely result from among bed variation in wasting disease lesions and top down control of leaf epiphytes.","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","California Sea Grant, Eureka, CA","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","California Department of Fish & Wildlife, Eureka, CA","Department of Oceanography, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA",,,,NA,NA,"Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","Wiyot Tribe, Loleta, CA","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA","Shaughnessy, F.J.","Abell, J.",,,,NA,NA,"Tyburczy, J.","LeBlanc, E.","Jones, A.","Ray, J.","Lopiccolo, J","Nelson, T.","Raether, S.","Landaw, K.",10,No,,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Eggs incubate out of water in slightly moist sand between semilunar high tides before hatching is triggered by wave action. Hatchlings swim out to sea within the same wave that caused hatching, but sometimes embryos partially hatch with their egg membrane, the chorion, still on their heads. Partial hatching has not been defined, studied or its causes determined, but it puts grunion at an early disadvantage by hindering swimming and covering their gills. We tested environmental factors during incubation to see whether they increase the percentage of partial hatchlings. Incubation in aerated and still sea water was tested against the control of sand to assess effects of oxygen availability and boundary layers at normal (control) and elevated incubation temperatures, 20 ? and 30 ?, respectively. A Chi-Square analysis of the data showed that all experimental conditions led to a higher percentage of partial hatchlings than the controls. These conditions may cause changes in chorion composition, embryonic development, or both, and thereby hinder complete hatching. This has implications for the development of other fish species whose eggs incubate in air such as *Fundulus heteroclitus* and *Austrofundulus limnaeus*. Further study will examine environmental effects on development with cartilage and bone stains on preserved hatchlings incubated in each environmental condition to assess abnormalities.",,,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Le Sage, O.L.",,,,,NA,NA,"Martin, K.L.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Humboldt Bay, California is an example of an ocean-dominated estuary that, historically, contained exclusively soft substratum but now contains a range of human placed hard substrata. The objective of this study is to describe the seaweed community structures along several environmental gradients within Humboldt Bay. Eleven sites were sampled; ten in the Bay on rip-rap, mudflats, and salt marshes, and one rocky outer coast reference site in Trinidad, California. Biodiversity surveys were completed during summers 2017 & 2018 and winter 2018. Five vertical transects were randomly placed within each site and, within a transect, four quadrats were systematically placed within each high, mid, and low intertidal zone. In each quadrat, the percent cover of macroalgae, microalgae, sessile and epiphytic invertebrates, and substratum type were measured. Environmental covariates included elevation, water and air temperature, salinity, wave exposure, and desiccation. Overall, there were 111 algal species- 71 reds, 19 browns, and 21 greens. In general, sites closer to the bay entrance exhibited higher diversity whereas sites further from the entrance had lower diversity with thin filaments and sheets.

Despite sharing a habitat, these two species differ in their symbiont regime, with *C. varians* hosting dinoflagellate photosymbionts, and *Ircinia* hosting cyanobacterial photosymbionts. We conducted experiments to measure several aspects of their feeding patterns. The sponges were all assayed for pumping rates using dye-video analysis and microbiome composition. Inhalant and exhalant water samples were collected from each individual and analyzed for bacterial composition. The results indicated that *Ircinia* had a significantly higher pumping rate than *C. varians*. The microbiomes of both species were significantly different. Analysis of the bacterial composition of water samples revealed significant differences, both between species and between inhalant and exhalant samples.

Using Pacific rockfishes as a model, we are exploring the use of IGF-1 as a ‘biomarker’ metric of recent growth rate and food availability in the local environment. Dietary stresses such as low food consumption inhibit growth in part by blocking GH-stimulated liver IGF-1 release, but the mechanism(s) of inhibition are not known. In previous work, we demonstrated that individual variation in blood IGF-1 concentration in rockfishes correlates positively with food intake and growth rate. Here, we examined how food deprivation (fasting) affected GH induction of liver IGF-1 in juvenile gopher rockfish, *Sebastes carnatus*. Rockfish were fed or fasted for 14 d, and then injected with exogenous recombinant GH or saline (control). We found that fasting reduced liver IGF-1 mRNA levels, and observed that GH upregulated hepatic IGF-1 mRNAs 2.2-fold in fed fish, but only 1.4-fold in fasted fish, suggesting a nutrition-linked shift in GH-mediated IGF-1 induction. Transcripts encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta (HNF-3beta), a transcription factor linked to IGF-1 synthesis, were more abundant in fed fish, suggesting that downregulation of HNF-3beta expression under nutritional stress may contribute to lower blood IGF-1. These findings point to the downregulation of pathways involving HNF-3beta as a potential contributor to reduced IGF-1 production under nutritional stress.","Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo","Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo",NOAA Fisheries,NOAA Fisheries,"Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Bersin, T.V.",,,,,NA,NA,"Cordova, K.L.","Journey, M.L.","Beckman, B.R.","Lema, S.C.",,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Due to the economic and cultural importance of abalones, it is important to  understand the effects ocean acidification may have on their survival. However, access to equipment for controlling pH can be prohibitively expensive and inaccessible to secondary schools and developing nations. To make experimentation more universally available, we are developing a low-cost solution--an Arduino-based control system which measures, regulates, and records the pH of a closed tank system. Our goal is to maintain a steady pH of 7.5 (+/- 0.1) and store the pH values throughout the experiment. Design and performance parameters of the current iteration of the system are presented here.

Because of their longevity rockfish are subjected to a number of large-scale ocean warming events that occur at a variety of temporal scales (Pacific Decadal Oscillation vs. El Niño Southern Oscillation) as well as variable and unpredictable events such as the Blob. However, there is little information about how these events might influence life history parameters that inform stock assessments. The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program has been conducting hook and line monitoring of nearshore rockfish annually along the central coast of California since 2007 to collect size, catch per unit effort, and species composition data. We examined the relationship between ocean water quality parameters, before and during large-scale warming events from 2007 - 2017, to average annual growth, using a cohort analysis of Blue rockfish (*Sebastes mystinus*). Our preliminary analyses suggest that there is an inverse relationship between an increase in water temperature and cohort growth during large-scale warming events such as El Niño and the Blob. We will further explore the relationship between ocean water quality parameters and life history traits by expanding our analysis to include additional sources of water quality data as well as to explore different measures of growth. These data will help stock assessments better account for the impacts of large-scale ocean warming events on key life history traits, thereby leading to improved management of groundfish stocks.","Center for Coastal Marine Sciences, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo","Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service","Center for Coastal Marine Sciences, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo","Center for Coastal Marine Sciences, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo",,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Waltz, G.T.",,,,,NA,NA,"Monk, M.H.","Ruttenberg, B.I.","Wendt, D.E.",,,,,,4,Yes,,,I am not a student or am not presenting,,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Under the species-sorting paradigm, individual hosts serve as patches of habitat that are colonized by microbes compatible with the host environment. The host environment is dynamic, and it is unclear how variation of the host environment alters microbial communities. We hypothesize that differences in the host environment, through changes in host ontogenetic stage, sex, and diet, will lead to differences in gut microbial community structure in signal crayfish *Pacifastacus leniusculus*. We conducted a laboratory experiment where juvenile and adult crayfish were fed either mussels or algae over 4 weeks. Using the V4 region of the 16s ribosomal RNA gene, we characterized bacterial diversity in crayfish collected in the field and from the experiment. Proteobacteria was the dominant taxa found in both the lab and field; Firmucutes was the second most common taxa found predominantly in crayfish from the field. We found that crayfish fed algae had higher microbial diversity than crayfish fed mussels. Phylogenetic relationships between bacteria explained community differences between ontogenetic stages. Our results suggest that gut microbial communities in this system are sensitive to the diet of their host and that changes in gut microbiota may allow crayfish to optimize nutritional or energetic gains from their diet.","Oregon State University, Uppsala University",Uppsala University,Uppsala University,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Segui, L.M.",,,,,NA,NA,"Varg, J.E.","Svänback, R.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

These toxins can cause substantial economic loss to the geoduck fishery through increased sampling costs and by delaying or closing harvest. In Southeast Alaska, the commercial geoduck fishery is lucrative, with annual ex-vessel value averaging $4.7 million (2010-2018). In recent years, this fishery has been hampered by PSTs as 76% of management areas failed weekly PST testing over four harvest seasons. Clam toxicity within a harvest area varied substantially from week-to-week, fluctuating well above (e.g., 900µg) and below (e.g., 40µg) the regulatory limit of 80µg saxitoxins/100g shellfish tissue. Such variation occurs throughout winter months, long after these phytoplankton are gone from the water column. To better understand patterns of variability in PSTs and geoduck toxicity in Southeast Alaska, we are mapping benthic *Alexandrium* cyst distributions and identifying locations of high cyst densities within clam harvest areas. We are also testing the hypothesis that ingestion of overwintering *Alexandrium* cysts is a mechanism for toxicity during winter months. By working with the dive industry and regulatory agencies to sample sediments in geoduck harvest areas we have already identified *Alexandrium* cysts in a majority of open fishing areas in the 2017/2018 season. The goal of this research is to better inform the fishery with respect to how geoduck clams may acquire PSTs and support a safer fishery.","University of Alaska Fairbanks, College of Fisheries and Ocean Science, 17101 Point Lena Loop Road, Juneau, AK 99801","Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe, Natural Resources, 1033 Old Blyn Hwy, Sequim, WA, 98382","Southeast Alaska Regional Dive Fishery Association, 1225 Tongass Avenue, Ketchikan, AK 99901","Sitka Tribe of Alaska Environmental Research Lab, 456 Katlian Street, Sitka, AK, 99835","University of Alaska Fairbanks, College of Fisheries and Ocean Science, 17101 Point Lena Loop Road, Juneau, AK 99801",,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Hart, C.E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Tobin, E.D.",Sullivan K.,"Lanphier, K.",Eckert G.L.,,,,,5,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Calcifying organisms are affected structurally, (coral becomes brittle, pteropods lose shell density). However, few studies have been conducted on the behavioral effects of ocean acidification. Increasing hydrogen ion concentrations associated with acidification may change the voltage gradients across neurons, which would drive behavioral changes unless a compensatory mechanism is present. We examined  two species of anthozoan cnidarian: *Aiptasia* and *Anthopleura*. The organisms were tested for a time period of around 200 days in waters with high pH (8.3) and low pH (7.5) to mimic current and future ocean acidity. The tests themselves focused on necessary biological responses (food collection and predator evasion), and expansion/contraction rates were recorded. Our results showed that there was not a noticeable change in either species’ behaviors. This may suggest a compensatory mechanism that might enable these organisms to cope with the changing hydrogen ion concentrations.",The Santa Catalina School,The Santa Catalina School,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Guan, SY",,,,,NA,NA,"Gilbert, M.

Microplastics are < 5mm and are abundant and hazardous in the marine environment. Organisms may ingest them and be exposed to harmful chemicals.  Rockfish are susceptible to microplastic ingestion as they are opportunistic feeders. Rockfish were sampled from three coastal Oregon locations, outside two Oregon marine reserves (Cape Perpetua, Cascade Head), and off the coast of Newport, OR. Their digestive tracts were examined to determine if they contained suspected microplastics. Undigested prey items were analyzed separately. The percent of fish in the given population obtained from outside marine reserves (n=61) and Newport (n=68) containing suspected synthetics or microplastics lies between 11.03% and 31.59% and 3.07% and 17.5%, respectively, within a 95% CI. Fish caught outside the two reserves contained more suspected microplastics than those sampled near Newport, OR (p-value = 0.01596). The suspected synthetics were identified following digestion in KOH and further categorized under a stereoscope. Suspected microplastics need to be confirmed using Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. These data show that nearshore species may be impacted by waste management shortfalls and are consuming synthetic materials. Continued research is needed to determine how much plastic and synthetic material is found within water, the amount ingested or accumulated by marine organisms, and how vital species are impacted.",Oregon State University,"University of California, Davis",Oregon State University,Oregon State University,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Landry, J.G.",,,,,NA,NA,"Agrawal, A.","Lasdin, K.S","Brander, S.M",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",3,,,,

Specifically, the temperature-size rule predicts a shift in both community composition and population size from larger to smaller bodied organisms correlated to increases in temperature. To investigate this hypothesis, our historical ecology class broke into three teams and compared contemporary and historical data on the sizes and abundances of three intertidal grazers: the chiton *Katharina tunicata*, the whelk *Nucella lamellosa*, and the anemone *Anthopleura elegantissima*. Trends in decreasing body sizes were not apparent. *K. tunicata* body length, *N. lamellosa* shell length, and *A. elegantissima* basal diameter averages were mostly similar to historical values.  Furthermore, when comparing abundances of these three species, community composition was similarly stable between historical and contemporary times.

To further understand this phenomenon and the effect that changing oceanic conditions will have on demersal fish species and benthic invertebrate communities, this study focuses on gathering imagery to track changes in species composition and abundance across the state of California. To achieve this, we have started a crowd-sourcing effort to engage divers, fishermen, and scientists along the coast of California. The imagery and fixed-location approach proposed in this study aids in 1) placing marine organisms in the ecological context in which they occur, 2) capturing and quantifying rare individuals and/or species occurrence in sites they are not normally associated with, and 3) reducing the uncertainty of climate change related impacts to demersal fish species and benthic invertebrates. As a result, we expect to obtain an estimate of the rate and direction of change of demersal communities, an advance warning of changes in abundances of harvested fish populations, early detection of invasive species, and stakeholder involvement in the monitoring of state and federal resources.","California State University, Monterey Bay","California State University, Monterey Bay",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Salinas Ruiz, Paulina",,,,,NA,NA,"Lindholm, James",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Considerably less is known about the mid-depth zone (30-50 meters) that likely serves as an important transition between shallow and deep water fish assemblages. This project uses SCUBA, both diver- operated stereo video and underwater visual census, to quantify community composition and microhabitat associations of demersal fishes over the diel cycle in the deep photic zone of the Carmel submarine canyon. Abundance and position of fishes within four habitat categories are sampled up to three times weekly. To date, we have observed 542 fishes across 20 species. Nearly all species have been observed by day with 8 species observed by night. Species with small maximum sizes (squarespot and halfbanded rockfishes, and blackeye gobies) accounted for 73% of the diurnal community, with larger individuals (>20cm) mainly consisting of fish the deep assemblage occurring nocturnally. Data collected to-date are consistent with other diurnal studies suggesting the deep photic zone of temperate reefs may serve as a nursery for immature fish during ontogenetic transitions to deeper water.

It is vital that the effects of these changes on marine organisms be explored so that we may predict how marine communities may be altered. In particular, the effect of environmental change on trematode parasites is a pressing area of research, due to the lack of knowledge in this area and the important ecological role of this group of parasites. We conducted an experiment examining the effect of warming and ocean acidification on an echinostomatid trematode from Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Specifically, we quantified the longevity of the free-living cercarial life stage, which is related to the probability of transmission to the secondary host. We found increased temperature to negatively affect this echinostomatid species, as cercarial longevity was highest at 5 °C and decreased with increasing temperature up to 40 °C. The effect of CO2 was most pronounced at lower temperatures, with increased pCO2 causing decreased longevity in some cases. These results indicate that changing oceanic temperature and pH may affect the longevity of cercariae and consequently impact infection success. Because trematode parasites are important members of intertidal communities whose presence or absence can regulate the abundance of host species in the system, a change in infection success of trematode cercariae due to climate change could greatly affect many marine intertidal communities.","Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada","Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada","Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada

Damselfish are pugnacious territory defenders and provide an opportunity to study the ways in which defense costs are balanced. Since relatively little research has been conducted on *Hypsypops rubicundus* (Garibaldi), the territorial behavior of the species around Isla Natividad, BCS was assessed. Territorial chase rate, foraging bite rate, and length was recorded for each territory holder as well as the length and species of intruders chased and chase initiation distance. This study indicates that chase rate on conspecifics increases as Garibaldi density increases. Chase initiation distance decreases as the size difference between territory holder and conspecific intruder increases, thus Garibaldi expend more effort to chase intruders of a similar size. There is no relationship between size difference and chase initiation difference with heterospecific intruders.  *C. punctipinnis* were chased at the greatest distance from the nest, *S. pulcher* at an intermediate distance, and *G. nigricans* at the least distance. There is no difference in chase rate or chase initiation distance between reserve and control sites. The increased chase rate at higher Garibaldi density may stem from a higher encounter rate or a heightened competition for territory. Conspecifics of a similar size are likely chased at a greater distance because they are most apt to usurp territory.

"Bennett, Audrey",audben@stanford.edu,2018-10-07 16:01,"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SURFGRASS, GRAZERS, AND EPIPHYTIC ALGAE ALONG A NUTRIENT GRADIENT IN MONTEREY BAY","In seagrass ecosystems, grazers play a key role in maintaining seagrass health by controlling the overgrowth of epiphytic algae. Meanwhile, anthropogenic nutrient loading can potentially impact this interaction by  facilitating algal growth, which may negatively affect seagrass. In this study, we examined the relationship between surfgrass bed (*Phyllospadix torreyi*) health and grazer abundance (*Pagarus granosimanus, P.hirsutiusculus, Chlorostoma funebralis*) under different nutrient loading conditions. To do this, we conducted field surveys across six sites within Monterey Bay that have potentially varying levels of nutrient loading. We found that the estimated nutrient level at each site was not related to epiphyte biomass on surfgrass. Interestingly, abundance of hermit crabs, but not total grazer abundance, was negatively related to epiphyte biomass, suggesting that hermit crabs may play particularly important roles in controlling epiphytes. Moreover, hermit crab abundance showed a weak positive relationship with seagrass biomass, which indicates that hermit crabs could be important for maintaining overall seagrass health. The lack of nutrient effects may have been due to strong seasonal recruitment of epiphytic algae like *Smithora naiadum* in low nutrient sites. These results suggest that grazers may play important roles in surfgrass ecosystems by reducing epiphyte biomass.

For example, there is potential for photosynthesizing organisms, such as macrophytes, to locally mitigate the effects of ocean acidification by providing microhabitats of higher pH as well as oxygen. Using a kelp removal experiment developed during a subtidal ecology course taught at Friday Harbor Labs in the summer of 2018, we investigated the effects of disturbance on an understory kelp forests and how the loss of kelp habitat impacted the physics, chemistry, and biology of the benthic system. Divers conducted algal and macroinvertebrate surveys within 6 8-m diameter plots, at 5 m depth, prior to and after removing all visible kelp thalli from three removal plots. We then measured pH variability, dissolved oxygen concentrations, relative water flow, light penetration, and mobile macrofauna usage in experimental kelp clearings (n=3) and reference plots (n=3). Kelp removal increased light penetration to the benthos and increased relative water movement. Water chemistry analysis suggests stronger physical rather than biological drivers in pH and dissolved oxygen variability. Several mobile fauna were noted utilizing the removal plots, and removal plots had lower species evenness than reference plots. The results from this study will help direct future research on kelp forest regime shifts and local influences on biogeochemical variability that may inform responses of benthic habitats to ocean acidification and hypoxia.",California State University Northridge,University of Washington,University of Oregon,California State University Northridge,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Panos, D.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Lowe, A.T.","Galloway, A.W.E.","Nickols, K.J.",,,,,,4,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

However, identifying the effects of endogenous versus exogenous variables on cetacean physiology remains a substantial challenge in part because of the logistical constraints that limit the collection of physiological data in wild animals. Measuring genome-wide gene expression is one minimally invasive method that can be used to elucidate how wild cetaceans’ physiological responses shift with changing environmental conditions or demographic states, i.e. reproductive status, maturity. We identified transcriptomic differences among bottlenose dolphins (*Tursiops truncatus*) from the Southern California Bight using RNAseq data from the skin of 75 individuals to examine gene expression associated with sex, pregnancy status, sea surface temperature, geographic location, and ecotype. We identified transcriptomic variation between two genetically distinct ecotypes as well as variation related to environmental conditions among groups that exhibit little evidence of genetic divergence. Specifically, we found differential expression of genes associated with structural development, cellular starvation, and immune response. Sex and pregnancy status explained a small proportion of the observed variation, in contrast to surface temperature, which explained a substantial amount of transcriptomic variation. Additional research is needed to identify other endogenous or exogenous factors that may be contributing to the remaining unexplained transcriptomic variation observed in this study.","Department of Biology, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanile Dr., San Diego, CA, 92182, USA

It is a habitat former as its canopy provides refuge from desiccation stress for a diverse understory community. In addition, *Silvetia* typically recruits underneath the rockweed canopy. Over the past several decades, rockweeds have exhibited patterns of declines in southern California, due likely in part to anthropogenic disturbances, thus there has been an interest in approaches to restore this ecologically important species. This study examined the effectiveness of *Silvetia* restoration in Newport Beach, CA, at a location where rockweeds were previously common, by transplanting adults from an adjacent donor site to the restoration site in varying densities (0, 1, 2, and 4 individuals per 0.09 m2 plot). We monitored transplant survival and growth, rockweed and other algal recruitment, and understory community composition over a 12-month period. While data analyses are in progress, preliminary patterns suggest restoration was successful with moderate survival of transplants over the year period. Contrary to expectations, transplant density appeared to have little effect on rockweed fitness (survival and growth) and understory community composition. However, as expected, recruitment of *Silvetia* appeared to be elevated under higher density transplant treatments, suggesting transplanting in higher densities could lead to higher establishment and long-term persistence of the population.","California State Polytechnic University, Pomona","California State Polytechnic University, Pomona",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Tronske, N.T.",,,,,NA,NA,"Smith, J.R.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,"No, I do not wish to be considered for an award",,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

FROM DIFFERENT MICROHABITATS EXHIBIT DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS?,"Cryptic species may partition foraging behaviors in response to microhabitat stressors and food availability. *Leptasterias* spp. is a genus of predatory sea stars found in intertidal habitats along the west coast of North America. Previous studies have suggested that *Leptasterias* spp. may adapt to different levels of wave exposure by adjusting their mobility, with stars from more wave-exposed sites remaining stationary in comparison with less wave-exposed stars. We investigated the foraging activity of *Leptasterias* spp. from sites with inferred high and low wave exposure in central and northern California (n=20, 27). Prior to collection, we estimated field prey availability by quantifying abundance in quadrats surrounding individual stars. Mussels were significantly more abundant in more wave-exposed sites (Mann Whitney U = 18, p = .039) and snails were more abundant in less wave-exposed sites (Mann Whitney U = 14, p = .044). Foraging behaviors were then tested in gridded tanks, with observations occurring every 5 minutes over 60 minute trials. Stars from less wave-exposed sites were more active than more wave-exposed stars (Mann Whitney U = 173.5, p = 0.038). Stars from more wave-exposed sites were more often observed crawling out of the water (Mann Whitney U = 25, p = 0.038), while stars from less wave-exposed sites were more often using their tube feet at the water’s surface (Mann Whitney U = 17.5, p = 0.009). These behavioral differences may reflect differential adaptation to prey accessibility and stressors associated with low and high wave exposed microhabitats.","Estuary and Ocean Science Center, San Francisco State University",University of Portland,"Estuary and Ocean Science Center, San Francisco State University",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Johnson, M.W.",,,,,NA,NA,"Shough, A.E.","Cohen, C.S.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

"Sapkos, Kaitlyn",ksapkos@mail.sfsu.edu,2018-10-07 19:51,A comparison of parental and larval genotypes in chimeric Didemnum vexillum colonies,"Chimerism has been documented in many invertebrate taxa, including cnidarians, bryozoans, and colonial ascidians. Allogeneic interactions in chimeric colonies are poorly characterized in the invasive colonial ascidian Didemnum vexillum. Genets in a chimeric colony may compete for access to the germline, potentially impacting the fitness of one or more genotypes within a chimera. D. vexillum colonies brood larvae until they are able to settle, so zooids in genetically heterogeneous colonies may invest resources into developing larvae from another genet in the colony. In this study, we determined the parentage of larvae brooded in different areas of chimeric D. vexillum colonies to assess the relative reproductive contributions of different genets. Using microsatellite genotyping of brooded larvae and the adjacent adult zooids, we found that a single brood may contain offspring from multiple genets. This initial work, compared the genotypes of 4 zooids and 16  larvae from 2 chimeric D. vexillum colonies. Broods contained larvae parented by both the adjacent zooids and allogeneic zooids found in other regions of the colony. This suggests that zooids in chimeric colonies brood both their own larvae and larvae from other genets, indicating the potential for unequal reproductive contributions among genets in chimeric colonies. Determining the relative reproductive input of different genets in a chimera is important in understanding the fitness consequences of chimerism in D. vexillum and the potential for chimerism to influence the genetic structure of populations.","Estuary and Ocean Science Center, Department of Biology, San Francisco State University","Estuary and Ocean Science Center, Department of Biology, San Francisco State University","Estuary and Ocean Science Center, Department of Biology, San Francisco State University",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Sapkos, Kaitlyn E.

In the Gulf of Maine, waters have been warming at an average rate of 0.24°C/year since the 1990s. However, marine heat waves bring a rapid shift in temperature to the subtidal zone. Marine heat waves occur when peak summer air temperatures correspond with an ebb tide, increasing temperatures by up to 5°C above average before decreasing again on the flood tide. To test the effect of heat waves on *S. droebachiensis*,18 urchins were acclimated to tidal temperature fluctuations between 13°C-17°C. We simulated a 3-day marine heat wave by exposing 9 urchins to a daily tide cycle with a maximum temperature of 22°C. Respiration was measured continuously during the tide cycle, and righting time was recorded as urchins were inverted at regular intervals. Urchins were returned to their acclimation tank following each daily exposure and the same individuals were used each day. Preliminary results indicate that the initial exposure to 22°C induces stress in urchins, but stress is relieved as temperatures decrease during the flood portion of the tide cycle. Additionally, urchins appear able to acclimate during heat waves as subsequent daily exposures did not produce an equivalent stress response. Understanding the behavioral and metabolic response of mesograzers to extreme temperature fluctuations will help predict their future success with rising temperatures.",University of Massachusetts Boston,College of Charleston,University of Massachusetts Boston,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"McCollum, B.A.",,,,,NA,NA,"Adjunta, D.","Byrnes, J.E.K.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award),NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Previous experiments have shown that mussels raised in low pH seawater are typically smaller, have thinner and weaker shells, and exhibit poor physiological condition compared to those living under ambient conditions. In contrast, calcifying predatory crabs have exhibited mixed responses – negative, neutral, or positive – depending upon the species and life stage considered. If crabs get larger and stronger as mussels become smaller and weaker, the predator-prey relationship between the two taxa could be dramatically altered against mussels. We have developed a mechanistic model parameterized with data from the field and lab to predict effects of OA and crab predation on mussel population growth and persistence. Mussel population fitness, as a function of projected reproductive output, can then be compared among models representing different combinations of OA and predation risk. We evaluated the effects of changes in mussel shell thickness and growth rate, and changes in crab carapace size, claw strength, and feeding and foraging behavior on mussel population performance. Scenarios with the greatest negative impact involved limitations on the ability of mussels to reach a predation-resistant size – specifically, decreases in mussel growth rate and/or increases in crab size. We are currently testing our predictions with manipulative experiments done under controlled conditions in the laboratory.","Department of Biological Sciences, California State University, Long Beach, CA 90840","Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA 95521","Department of Biological Sciences, California State University, Long Beach, CA 90840",,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Haas, A.C.",,,,,NA,NA,"Bourdeau, P.E.","Allen, B.J.",,,,,,,3,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Current work is focused on developing methods for mapping kelp extent and biomass at different spatial scales using a variety of remote sensing tools. At a coast-wide scale, we are developing a tool within Google Earth Engine (GEE) to automate the detection of kelp using the Landsat satellite image archive. Within its limitations, the GEE kelp mapping tool provides an efficient and spatially transferable method for mapping canopy kelp extent and reconstructing coast-wide kelp extents for the past three decades. At local and regional scales, ongoing research is focused on pairing *in situ* diver data on kelp biomass with multispectral drone imagery (8 cm resolution) and satellite imagery (2 m resolution) to examine remote sensing methods for differentiating between kelp species and mapping kelp biomass and extent.

Conversely, tropical rocky intertidal shores have often been described as bare rock dominated, consisting of low biotic abundance. Our community composition studies at 35 rocky intertidal sites in Costa Rica (5 Caribbean, 30 Pacific) support this pattern, with quadrats from the high to low zone being dominated by bare rock. While macroalgae and macroinvertebrates were present, particularly in the low zone, they were often small in size. The abiotic and biotic drivers of community composition in tropical rocky intertidal systems have been understudied. To elucidate the roles of two factors, herbivory and nutrient supply, in driving species abundances, settlement plates were placed in the mid to low zones at 3 sites on the Nicoya Peninsula (Pacific coast) of Costa Rica. Settlement plates were exposed to combinations of herbivory (cages +/-) and nutrient enrichment (+/-) treatments (plus a cage control) and monitored for biotic cover/biomass over a 10-week period. At the end of the experiment, most plates were covered by biota, mostly macroalgae, with preliminary analyses suggesting that neither herbivory nor nutrients had a detectable effect. This study is important as it creates a baseline of community composition of Costa Rican intertidal systems that had previously been minimally studied. In addition, this study sheds light on the potential negligible role of herbivory and nutrients in driving tropical rocky shore composition.","California State Polytechnic University, Pomona","California State Polytechnic University, Pomona",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Arre, B.C.",,,,,NA,NA,"Smith, J.R.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

Since 2013, Sea Star Wasting Disease (SSWD) has led to a devastating marine epizootic, causing drastic declines in many populations. The small, brooding sea star *Leptasterias* spp. has faced severe but regionally variable population declines during SSWD, disappearing from some sites but persisting at others. Unlike many larger, broadcast-spawning stars, *Leptasterias* have limited larval dispersal, leading to low gene flow and localized population differentiation that may affect disease survivorship. In California, clades *L. aequalis* K and *L. aequalis* B were common at sites where *Leptasterias* populations persisted, whereas clades *L. aequalis* D and Clade Y were abundant at sites that showed population extirpations during SSWD. Additionally, in Washington, clades *L. aequalis* A and *L. hexactis* were reported prior to SSWD at sites where Leptasterias remain abundant. We use mitochondrial CO1 barcoding to characterize contemporary clade composition at Washington, Oregon and California sites where *Leptasterias* populations remain, in order to assess regional differences in clade survivorship. We report the presence of Clade Y at contemporary Oregon sites where *Leptasterias* is currently abundant, suggesting that observed declines of this clade in California may be multifactorial.

In particular, “mega-fires”—wildfires with extraordinary scope and intensity—have become more frequent. During fall 2014, a mega-fire known as the King Fire tore through Eldorado National Forest in the northern Sierra Nevada, burning a swath of 97,717 acres. Habitat near the geographic center of the King Fire burned at a high severity and tree mortality reached 100%, whereas habitat near the edges of the fire burned in heterogeneous mixed-severity patches. Three years after the fire, we established 27 sites across this gradient (9 high-severity, 9 mixed-severity, and 9 unburned) in order to investigate post-fire small mammal community recovery. At each 1-hectare site, we sampled small mammals using 100-m^2^ Sherman trapping grids. We used a spatial capture-recapture model to estimate small mammal density at each site, and calculated standard diversity indices. In burned sites, the overall density of small mammals increased while diversity decreased, with a shift towards communities overwhelmingly dominated by deer mice (*Peromyscus maniculatus*) and a loss of rare species such as shrews and woodrats. Although we found that small mammals were more abundant after a mega-fire, the loss in diversity signifies a decrease of species that might be providing essential ecosystem services.",University of California - Santa Barbara,University of California - Davis,,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Culhane, K.E.",,,,,NA,NA,"Sollmann, R.",,,,,,,,2,I am a student and am not eligible to judge,,,Yes and I am a graduate student,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,NA,,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",1,,,,

The activities of the invasive lionfish (*Pterois volitans*) are of primary concern, as they reduce the overall recruitment of Caribbean reef fishes by as much as 80%. Assessing the repercussions of lionfish remains a difficult task, and predicting their impacts on communities is even more challenging. A central question is whether the lionfish represents a truly novel predator in this ecosystem, or whether it is significantly similar to any native species. Furthermore, does the lionfish restore any predatory function? Here the trophic impacts of lionfish on Caribbean coral reef community structure will be assessed using a functional ecospace, and a high resolution model of a Greater Antillean coral reef food web. The food web model is used to estimate species trophic properties, including trophic level, food chain lengths and prey resource overlap, and the ecospace provides a metric for interspecific similarities based on functional traits. Preliminary results indicate that lionfish forage over a broad range of prey, with varying trophic habits, adaptations, body sizes, and depth distributions. Simulations of plausible interactions based on the food web model show that the number of trophic interactions increases significantly with addition of the lionfish, while connectance does not, signifying the unusual breadth of the invader’s interactions.","California Academy of Sciences, Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Geology, San Francisco, CA 94118","California Academy of Sciences, Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Geology, San Francisco, CA 94118",,,,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,"Chin, C.

"McDonald, P. Sean",psean@uw.edu,,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT FEEDING PATTERNS OF DUNGENESS AND GRACEFUL CRABS,"Local population decline of the Dungeness crab (Cancer [Metacarcinus] magister) has led to closure of the South Puget Sound Dungeness crab fishery. Yet populations of their competitor, the graceful crab (C. [M.] gracilis) are robust and potentially increasing. The economic and cultural importance of the Dungeness crab has provided impetus to questions the mechanism(s) behind this disparity. Temperature may be one factor that can help explain distributional differences between these species, and examination of the effects of varying temperature on consumption rates, ingestion loss, and egestion may also provide a lens through which to examine potential consequences of climate change in the Puget Sound region on C. [M] magister, C. [M] gracilis, and their common prey items. This study aimed to quantify energy requirements of consumption, ingestion loss and egestion at varying temperatures, and obtain values for use in bioenergetics models for both Dungeness and graceful crabs. To obtain these values, we performed consumption experiments on Dungeness and graceful crabs in aquaria across a range of sizes and temperatures. Following an initial starvation and acclimation period and a 24-hour feeding period, ingestion loss and egestion were measured by collecting uneaten food and fecal material, respectively. Maximum feeding rates for graceful crab occur at higher temperatures than for Dungeness crab. Results of this project describe size and temperature-dependent feeding patterns that can inform fishery management and be useful in future ecological modelling, and represent the first experimentally based values of ingestion loss and egestion obtained directly for Dungeness and graceful crabs.

Despite previous studies documenting populations in estuarine habitats in British Columbia, California, and Baja California, our knowledge of its distribution along the North American Pacific is incomplete. In 2017, we surveyed 61 sites from Chusini Cove (Prince of Wales Island, Alaska) to Bayside Park (San Diego Bay, California), spanning more than 23º of latitude. We documented 33 new sites where G. vermiculophylla is currently found, but may have been previously overlooked, or not recognized. Many of these locations were areas of intensive shellfish aquaculture, particularly oysters, and are also important flyover stops for migrating birds, possibly contributing to the spread of this seaweed. Our study fills in the significant gaps in the distribution of G. vermiculophylla in North America, and, as such, will be an important contribution to future studies on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this widespread marine invasion along this coastline.","Department of Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham","College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, University of Alaska Fairbanks","Florida State University, Department of Biological Science","Department of Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham",,,,,,,,,,,,"Krueger-Hadfield, S.
